    "1. **Spam emails misclassified as ham:** \n",
    "    1. Case 0 contains lots of email addresses. But that's just one probable reason why the model misclassifies it as ham. Perhaps the more important reason is that the content is full of random permutations of letters and not actual English words. It is highly likely that the model has not seen these letter permutations before, so they are ignored during vectorization even if they could be important to identifying spam. Maybe I could check emails first for unusual terms.\n",
    "    2. Case 1 appears harmless because it only talks about the effect of weather and climate, something regular people could talk about. The model probably misclassifies the email as ham because it lacks sketchy words typically seen in spam emails. I think even humans will find it hard to classify emails like these as spam or ham. Maybe adding the emails' subjects later on will help.\n",
    "    3. Case 2 appears to consists of valid words, which are also words not to be expected in spam emails. However, when these words are put together, they make no sense at all.\n",
    "2. **Ham emails misclassified as spam:**\n",
    "    1. Case 0 looks like a promotional email for a media app. Although it's official status in the dataset is ham, it looks like spam because it's inviting the email recipient to visit some external link about a product it offers. \n",
    "    2. Case 1 is a registration confirmation email sent by a bank. Similar to the media app promo, this email is probably misclassified as spam because it's inviting the email recipient to click some external link.\n",

In other words, even if those unusual words could just be random nonsense, they do not affect how the model classifies the email.\n",

To remedy this, I just added 1 to ``num_unusual_words`` for all observations so that there are no 0 values and then applied log transformation again. I already added 1 in ``count_unusual_words()``."

enron to delhi today monday april the real story of dabhol if a judicial probe suggested by the committee is ordered into the enron deal it could embarrass three government ranjit bhushan monday april mseb revenue collection up at r crore in march renni abraham the financial express april godbole \\x01 s report unearths absurd calculation maharashtra could use this to wriggle out of the dabhol project sucheta dalal it is finally quit india time for enron though the controversial multinational ha denied plan to sell it stake in dabhol power company dpc informed source say that it ha sent feeler to china light power and others to offload it majority holding getting out of india may be the best course for enron though it ha threatened a fight and invoked political force majeure the energy review committee headed by madhav godbole will certainly weaken it case the committee point out that the many \\x01 infirmity \\x01 in the dpc approval process brings into question the \\x01 propriety of the decision \\x01 it is clear that the m that enron spent on educating india \\x01 s policy maker and bureaucrat did not even teach them the basic of techno economic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contract the committee say it is \\x01 troubled with the failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on matter relating to dpc the failure of governance ha been broad across different government at different point of time at both the state and the central level and across different agency associated with examining the project and at both the administrative and political level it strain belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigned responsibility is purely co incidental \\x01 though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmity it two key member mr godbole and former secretary in the ministry of finance ea sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry into the process of clearing the dpc project other member felt a judicial inquiry would delay the negotiation process and \\x01 ¬ serve any purpose \\x01 there may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariff or facilitating enron \\x01 s exit but the report certainly provides the central vigilance commission cvc with all the ground that it need to start an investigation cvc n vittal ha already received innumerable request to investigate the deal especially the beneficiary of it education campaign though the political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry the cvc can establish whether there are lapse on the part of \\x01 government functionary including political executive \\x01 and ensure \\x01 appropriate action \\x01 against them if it is indeed able to establish \\x01 it deliberately us expensive raw material ignoring world bank warning ha worked on fanciful demand supply estimate and several legal requirement and permission in fact the committee ha found that the mseb ha been paying enron r crore more than it should every year this comprises overcharging of r crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only per cent of the capacity is used for dpc there \\x01 s also a r crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charge although the cost of these facility had been included in the capital recovery charge by charging more than twice the operation maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india enron collect approximately r crore extra every year it ha also been collecting r crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claim enron ha been charging at kcal kwh under the power purchase agreement ppa although the equipment manufacturer ha guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate this give it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra the committee ha also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rate for different aspect of the project negotiation a rate of r per dollar wa assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loan r per dollar a reference rate for phase i r per dollar a reference rate for phase ii and a curious r per dollar for calculating government of india tariff forcing a reduction of these excessive charge ha nothing to do with contract cancellation all it need is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment the godbole committee ha established that dpc \\x01 s tariff can easily be halved if excess payment are eliminated and unfair condition such a the dollarisation of payment the take or pay clause and escrow facility which is in fact hampering mseb \\x01 s reform particularly in power distribution are scrapped the security of future payment to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flow from a reformed distribution system the committee also give enron a difficult escape route it say that if the multinational find the condition for restructuring too onerous it should free mseb from it contractual obligation and find buyer outside maharashtra the committee ha tried to establish another precedent on all project negotiated by government \\x01 the public ha a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf \\x01 and ha recommended that all document including contract related to all independent power project ipps particularly dpc should be published by the maharashtra government within two month also having established that demand supply estimate by the state government were fanciful the committee ha asked mseb to defer all negotiation with power producer until demand level in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps it recommends that such negotiation should be in accordance with the least cost plan spelt out by the report this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance patalganga mittals bhadravati the bs saphale and others to set up ipps in maharashtra the financial express april dpc board set to authorise president enron md to issue notice of termination sanjay jog scrapping of power purchase agreement the board of director of dabhol power company dpc which ha already taken an aggressive posture ha proposed to authorise the enron india managing director k wade cline and dpc president and chief executive officer neil mcgregor to issue notice for the termination of power purchase agreement ppa and transfer of dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and central government and maharashtra state electricity board mseb the board of director which would meet on april in london also plan to appoint mr cline a it \\x01 true and lawful attorney in fact \\x01 and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contract and financing agreement and their amendment and modification top source told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notice and transfer notice to the state and central government and mseb under clause and schedule of the ppa \\x01 in response to the continuing default by the mseb of it payment obligation under the ppa the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligation under it guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligation under it counter guarantee the company ha sought recourse to dispute resolution and ha initiated conciliation and arbitration proceeding \\x01 the company resolution said \\x01 consistent with this recourse to contractual remedy the company now seek the authority to serve preliminary termination notice and transfer notice pursuant to clause and schedule of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to it right to serve such notice a determined by the company \\x01 the resolution added according to the resolution the director the company secretary and officer of the company and each of them acting individually are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such document and instrument and take such other action a they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution in the name and for and on behalf of the company against this backdrop the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibility of issuing termination notice to the dpc for it failure to meet the contractual obligation under the ppa the state government and mseb source said that such a notice could be served by the mseb a dpc ha not paid the rebate penalty of r crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january and february the state government and mseb which reviewed it position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial ground to slap the termination notice to the dpc the dpc \\x01 s move to appoint mr k wade cline a it \\x01 true and lawful attorney in fact \\x01 deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit state mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amount exceeding r crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year furthermore mr cline would be in a position to enter into contract and take any other action for purpose relating to the day to day operation of the company \\x01 s business or exercise it right and discharge it obligation under the

the lender while banker said the lender \\x01 meeting is about the second phase of the project which is still under construction state government official clarified that since there is only one ppa covering both phase of the project the lender \\x01 decision will be applicable to the existing phase i also the second phase of the project involves mw generation capacity whereas phase i of mw is already operational \\x01 according to the loan agreement even if only four per cent of the lender agree to terminate the contract then dpc can do so \\x01 highly placed source in the lender \\x01 consortium said from london this in effect mean that only one lender ha to agree for dpc to serve a preliminary termination notice following the notice there is a cooling off period of six month for both party the mseb and dpc to find a mutually acceptable solution which may take the form of a re negotiated ppa source added source also said that there are two separate meeting scheduled with

project to the centre mr prabhu said that the situation of the electricity board in the country wa precarious the centre had decided to assist maharashtra upto r crore every year to improve customer service outlook monday april the real story of dabhol if a judicial probe suggested by the committee is ordered into the enron deal it could embarrass three government ranjit bhushan the committee ha prima facie found infirmity in several decision taken in respect of the enron project at different point of time by successive government and agency in the centre and state energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole this could well be the real enron story a five member high powered committee headed by madhav godbole \\x01 and including former union economic affair secretary e a s sarma hdfc chairman deepak parekh teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal \\x01 ha recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process relating to the dabhol project the report which wa submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and ha been acquired by outlook is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar with the congress then the day bjp led union government which reworked the deal in shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision making relating to the dabhol project madhav godbole committee report an investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these three government the report clearly upholds the allegation of money being paid by enron to politician and bureaucrat for clinching the deal according to the committee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the centre and state and across different agency it strain belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibility is purely coincidental the report said proposing a set of measure to be implemented if something of the project wa to be retrieved godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry this wa finally adopted by it say a congress leader enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector the proposal ha already struck panic say ncp s praful patel if the enron decision ha at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with which phase wa cleared by the shiv sena bjp government now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron the important thing is to resolve it amicably a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it s not an issue of corruption but that of perception pro market congressman privately admit that it wa their government at the centre and the state which invited enron even though the second phase wa cleared by the bjp shiv sena combine say congress spokesperson jaipal reddy right now we re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka pro liberalisation congress mp also fear that such witch hunting could send wrong signal to foreign investor non congress mp from maharashtra meanwhile claim that the godbole committee wa instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue i think i know vilasrao deshmukh s gameplan say an mp from the state but some mp like congress prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that s surrounded the deal i ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this \\x01 the committee report also say that had the enron project been subjected to a techno economic appraisal a envisaged under provision of the electricity supply act of and related legislation the infirmity could have been avoided since this wasn t done question about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise the exhaustive page report point out i d highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government cleared the project minute before it quit say congress mp prithviraj chavan the enron project had been held out a an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early s and despite several controversy is now an established power project at dabhol km south of mumbai in july enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb to set up a mw station a part of the government s fast track project subsequently when the shiv sena bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project this curiously led to renegotiations with enron the committee ha quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal once it gom decided to revive the project it acted in the very same manner it predecessor in office had done it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made it proposal for renegotiatons which wa accepted by dabhol is unprecedented say chavan i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minute before it resigned since the commissioning of the plant in may the mseb ha paid r crore for the power it ha bought from dabhol if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian built power plant fired by indigenous coal the payment would have been approximately r crore in the first year and a half of it operation itself the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly r crore the central electricity authority cea in fact pointed out that the dabhol plant wa not the least costly option the mseb had other inexpensive alternative like the four unit of kaparkheda but they were in a preliminary stage the report note if the mseb had made effort to seriously pursue these project they might not have remained in their preliminary stage it add that the member were of the opinion that the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously based on information available at that time in proceeding with the dpc a a base load factor even when it capacity wa reduced the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry finance ministry and the cea it quote the cea a saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable no further examination wa required strangely bal thackeray s shiv sena when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal after the new shiv sena bjp government took over it cm manohar joshi appointed a renegotiating committee in which made the right noise actually managing to reduce the tariff but certain thing remained inexplicable no fresh clearance were required from the cea which also said that since no cost increase wa involved fresh formal clearance wasn t necessary say the committee this only add strength to the suspicion that the cea didn t consider the economic aspect of the project at all indeed given the non availability of any official record of the meeting on june with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspect of dpc were discussed at all the credibility of the shiv sena bjp government ha been seriously questioned the committee find it unexplicable sic why there wa no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from million to million a agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee the panel observes say lawyer prashant bhushan it is strange that the shiv sena bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal the committee further spell out the loss incurred through the deal subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc the financial deterioration of mseb ha been rapid while the mseb wa in profit in it plunged into huge loss of r crore in significantly the world bank in had predicted the system s inherent weakness in a letter written to the then power secretary r vasudevan a top bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumption we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project a presently formulated is not economically justified and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in the proposed base load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch a already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power enron s persistence and the gullibility of the indian side can be gauged from high ranking enron official joe sutton s letter to a key indian official ajit nimbalkar i recently met with the world bank and have been following the article in the india paper i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed we ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the medium from here on the project ha solid support from all other agency in washington the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra need outside intervention in the power sector at all for the first time the godbole committee ha raised objection about the viability of such a project according to the report the mseb ha been one of the better performing board in the country and ha despite a faulty transmission and distribution t and d system managed to consistently earn net revenue surplus on an accrual basis maharashtra account for nearly one fourth of the gross value of india s industrial sector it s one of the few state to achieve per cent electrification since the mseb ha been adding to it generation this improvement which ha been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb exceeded it own expectation at a time when the dpc wa being considered the report point out following a policy of cross subsidy roughly nine out of it ten user are subsidised but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn t been much in fact the subsidy claim decreased from r crore in to r crore in until in it increased nearly five fold to r crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by paisa per unit \\x01 from to paisa \\x01 an increase of per cent the increase in the subsidy claim by r crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase cost say the committee adding without the dpc and without problem of t and d loss the mseb could be financially healthy but can that happen now since enron is here to stay the committee ha come up with some far reaching recommendation make public all dabhol related document and agreement restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra re examine ppas in accordance with least cost plan and thoroughly reform the mseb the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion the question is can that be achieved in an unstable political environment with priya sahgal making of a scam centre invite enron to set up fast track power project dec first ppa signed with mseb enron start construction sena bjp govt scrap enron state govt renegotiates project day vajpayee govt approves counter guarantee may state cabinet clear ppa may phase i commissioned jul financial closure for phase ii oct mseb default on payment subsequently stop paying monthly bill feb enron invokes central government s counter guarantee business standard monday april mseb revenue collection up at r crore in march renni abraham the maharashtra state electricity board s mseb revenue collection in march stood at a record r crore this wa largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connection pegged at nearly disconnection a month which resulted in compliance by consumer with the dabhol power company dpc monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrator on the negotiating table the mseb ha turned to putting it house in order a if to ward of any criticism of it fiscal condition that could be termed a the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis the state electricity board ha put matter relating to it performance on record for instance mseb ha recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march at unit compared with the previous year s unit making it the top seb of the country in this respect similarly it power station recorded the highest availability percentage at up from per cent last fiscal plant load factor is up to per cent compared with per cent in the parli power station ha recorded the highest ever generation in the ten year of it life time in at million unit which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guideline issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of r lakh all other power station in the state without exception also fulfill the eligibility criterion for the cash award a senior mseb official said similarly the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the iso certification a senior mseb official said earlier mseb wa suffering from too much interference in it day to day functioning the agriculturist were touted a the major reason for it deteriorating accrual while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage wa conveniently camouflaged under this head in the recent past the government ha authorised mseb to take step to curb this misuse of power by it own official many of whom including a chief engineer have suffered suspension'"

    "- Some of these words with highest probabilities of appearing given that an email is ham are indeed usual words that we can expect in corporate emails, e.g. ``thanks``, ``attached``, ``know``, ``file``, ``let``, ``need``, ``day``, and ``time``. For example, an email message could be something like:\n",
    "> \"Hi, ``attached`` is the ``file`` you asked for last ``time``. ``let`` me ``know`` if there's anything else you ``need`` from me within the ``day``. ``thanks``.\"\n",
    "- During the preprocessing, I replaced all the names/email addresses of senders and recipients denoted by keywords like ``from``, ``forwarded by``, ``to``, ``cc``, ``@`` with the marker ``emailaddress``.  The high probability of ``emailaddress`` of appearing in ham emails is probably due one of the following reasons: (1) spam emails not having sender info, (2) corporate emails being sent/forwarded/cc'ed to multiple people.\n",
    "- Similarly, ``enron`` and ``ect`` are expected to be seen in corporate emails from the company Enron and one of its services, Enron Capital and Trade Resources (ECT).\n",
    "- The terms ``vince`` and ``kaminski`` appear in a lot of ham emails because the directory ``enron2`` consists of emails sent by and to Vince Kaminski, who according to Google Search results, was the Managing Director for Research at Enron."

termination of the contract  the\\nenron board  s  enabling resolution  did not have much significance beyond\\nconveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio  the\\nmaharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of\\ncrisis resolution by issuing a termination notice  the state government is to\\nnominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract \\nenron holds 65 per cent in dpc  while us  based ge and bechtel hold 10 per\\ncent each  the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special

meeting in london \\nthe essence of the message from the international lenders following the\\nlondon meeting with dpc board is  emotions do not work  contractual\\nobligations and payments have to be met  we are convinced that the mseb has\\nfailed to meet its obligations  there is no point in enron continuing with\\nthe project and the company should get out of it  the structuring of dpc \\x01  s\\ndebt has created two classes of lenders  in phase  i  international lenders\\nare covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase  ii  no lender is \\nhowever  all lenders have a parri passu charge  making attachment of assets a\\nmessy affair \\nsources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to\\nphase  ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect\\ntheir interests more given that they have no security \\x01  other than assets \\x01 \\nlike a sovereign cover  \\x01  it was this desperation that made local lenders like\\nidbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16  5 per cent from 21  5\\nper cent  \\x01 8 a leading foreign banker pointed out  three points that were made\\nclear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were  a \\nthere are contractual obligations b  mseb was not punctual in its payments to\\ndpc and c  mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore\\nrebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of\\npower \\nwhile local lenders led by idbi \\x01  with mseb parroting the same \\x01  were of the\\nview that the current situation is a temporary one  international lenders\\nwere steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out  this is\\ndespite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination\\ngiven to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for  international bankers\\npointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and\\nprotection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped\\nin its present form  the points of contention are  a  that phase  i of dpc is\\nbacked by a sovereign guarantee b  phase  ii is not and c  to the extent that\\nphase  ii is covered by assets  cancellation of phase  ii may see all assets \\x01 \\neven those under phase  i \\x01  getting attached  therefore  an examination on the\\nsegregation of assets under phase  i and phase  ii is now warranted \\npti adds  in a significant move  dpc board has empowered its management to\\nsever power supply agreement with mseb  a move that could inflict a financial\\nliability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre  a decision to authorise dpc\\npresident neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of\\npower was taken by the board at

placed  but mseb has paid  24\\nmillion for february  and a payment of  31 million was made for march on\\nthursday \\nthe  3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in

notice of termination of its power\\npurchase agreement  ppa  with the maharashtra state electricity board  has\\ndecided to keep a stiff upper lip  this  in turn  has stoked speculation that\\nthe switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent  while in\\nreality  a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa \\nas one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu    it is not sudden death\\nof the project   and in all probability  the dpc  vexed with the\\ndevelopments  including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole\\ncommittee  has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option    this would\\nonly eventually come into effect  it is not an overnight operation and a lot\\nof legal work is involved    apparently  the dpc intends to do some\\narm  twisting \\nat the board of directors meeting in london  which maharashtra was initially\\ndisinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions\\non the project  the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the\\noffer of renegotiation had come rather   too late    it also said it did not\\nsee any room for optimism about the outcome  it did not  however  rule out\\nthe option of talks  thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to\\nauthorise termination was a new weapon \\nthe maharashtra chief minister  mr  vilasrao deshmukh  had hoped that dpc\\nwould not take any   harsh step   which would cause lot of damage to the\\ninterests of both the independent power producer and the government and today\\nhe expressed his dismay  in fact  the mandate of the team that went  on the\\nstrength of its stake in the dpc  was to put across the idea that negotiation\\nwas the requirement and not confrontation \\necho in ls\\nthe enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister \\nmr  suresh prabhu  said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre\\nrs  2  840 crores  whose liability in the project

serious blow to the indian financial\\ninstitutions  fis  which  under the leadership of the idbi  were trying to\\nconvince the other lenders of the project against the notice  the exposure of\\nindian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee\\neither of the centre or the state \\nthe times of india  friday  27 april 2001\\nenron ready to pull out  but lenders say wait\\nthe dabhol power company board  which met on wednesday in london  authorised\\nthe company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state\\nelectricity board  the company  however  may not pull out of the project yet \\nconsidering its lenders  who met on monday  opposed such a move and favoured\\nrenegotiations  sources present during both the meetings said that though\\nforeign lenders supported enron on the termination issue  domestic financial\\ninstitutions  led by the industrial development bank of india  prevailed over\\nthe deliberations to oppose any such drastic move  enron needs the lenders \\nconsent to file a pre  termination notice for pulling out from the project \\nthe decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice\\nwas taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a\\nmove \\nanother significant development during the entire proceedings was that the\\nfinancial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the\\nproject will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms \\ninstitutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package \\nwhich is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project    the board\\nhas given powers to wade cline to issue a pre  termination notice  but the\\nmeeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the\\nproject but to initiate serious re  negotiation proceedings    said mseb\\nchairman vinay bansal  who attended the board meeting    mseb presented their\\nviews to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included\\nthe rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings \\n  we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high\\nand a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable   bansal added \\n  they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our\\nexposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any\\nplans in that direction    said a top banker who was present during the\\nlenders  meet    there is a general consensus that the project must be\\ncompleted and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance   \\nhe added  the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank \\ncredit suisse first boston  abn  amro  citibank and the state bank of india \\nwhere all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company\\nofficials  however  some bankers said the company can file a termination\\nnotice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project\\nfavours such proceedings \\nmeanwhile  in a clear reversal of roles  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao\\ndeshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa \\n  we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that\\nwould be bad news for all of us  including dpc    deshmukh said

is to mount additional pressure on\\nthe mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger\\nposition in settling its dispute with the mseb  as part of its plan to arm\\nitself

minister\\nsaid it was unfortunate \\nearlier  in his meeting with hazare  deshmukh promised to make necessary\\namendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so\\nthat the

lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the\\nmatter \\ndisclosing this  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that\\nthe state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power\\nproject at dabhol could be continued  and at the same time enron did not feel\\nslighted   enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision  we are\\nwaiting for their letter   he said  when asked what sort of compromise the\\nstate government plans to forge  mr  deshmukh said   let our officers come\\nback  after that we will decide a future course of action  but we are\\ndefinitely going in for renegotiation of the project  it is very difficult to\\npredict the outcome of enron  s decision but as of now the project is still\\non   when asked whether the project could be moved to another state  if wound\\nup from maharashtra  mr  deshmukh said  that was not possible as per the\\nterms of the agreement between the us company and the state government \\nhowever  it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself  he\\nindicated  he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses\\nif the project was terminated \\nthe board of directors of the dabhol power company  which met in london on\\nwednesday  decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project\\nonce and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project  if he\\ndeemed it fit  however  this decision  as of now  does not necessarily\\nindicate the death knell for the project  the enron project  which had been\\nriddled with controversies right from its inception  had been a pretext for\\nthe political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to\\ntime  the previous sena  bjp government  which had been out to terminate the\\nproject  however  chose to continue with it following renegotiations with\\nenron  s top visiting officials like ms  rebecca mark  and  the democratic\\nfront government inherited the controversial project when the governments\\nchanged hands a year and a half ago \\nmeanwhile  state energy minister dr  padamsinh patil  when contacted at the\\nosmanabad circuit house  said the state government and the central government\\nhave decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with\\nenron   it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that \\nthey will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both\\nsides   he said  in case the project is terminated  the government can still\\nmanage the power needs of the state  though it would be a bit tough job  he\\nadded '"

does not necessarily mean that mcgregor\\nwill issue such a termination notice  mcgregor was given the powers at a\\nmeeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday  ranganathan said that state\\nofficials  including maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  chairman\\nvinay bansal and power secretary v m lal  have reported back to him about the\\nmeeting in london \\nwith regard to the state  s failure to pay enron  ranganathan said   bills\\nare prepared as per the power purchase agreement  ppa  and dpc owes some\\nmoney to us  our people informed enron officials about this   in fact  there\\nwas no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice   in the\\nlondon meeting  mseb and industrial development bank of india  idbi \\nrepresentatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could\\nnot supply power whenever needed \\nchief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the\\ndecision of the board of the enron  promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to\\nwind up operations  deshmukh added   we have already requested enron not to\\ntake any harsh decision   deshmukh had earlier said   we have directed state\\ngovernment officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy\\ncompany from winding up operations in the state  as it would be harmful to\\nboth of us  \\nenron officials are keeping mum on the issue  mcgregor said   i am not going\\nto give any comment  \\nmid day  april 27  2001\\nenron offers  no comment  on renegotiation  h s rao\\na crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company\\n dpc   promoted by the us energy major enron  was held here yesterday\\napparently to discuss fate of its  900  million power project in maharashtra \\nbut there was no official word on the indian and state governments  decision\\nto renegotiate the contract \\nan enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting  saying\\nthe issues discussed at the meeting were  confidential    we have not\\nreceived any direct communication  unless we get it and evaluate the details \\nwe have no comments to make   the spokesman said when asked about the\\nproposed decision on re  negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra\\nstate electricity board  mseb  has 15 per cent stake \\nasked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing\\ndirector neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india  the spokesman said\\nhe had nothing to say on them  enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to\\nlook at various options including selling the company  s stake in dpc \\nmaharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state\\ngovernment would pay up the undisputed dues to the company  he said the\\nmaharashtra government  is not in favour of terminating the 2184  mw project \\nbut wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio  \\nmid day  friday  april 27  2001 \\ncommittee to renegotiate enron deal\\na committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power\\ncompany will be appointed by this evening  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh\\nsaid today  addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social\\nreformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha  deshmukh said the\\ncommittee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow  at the most  he\\ntermed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil\\nmcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state\\nelectricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with\\npower company \\n renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole\\ncommittee and the center will also depute its representative on the\\nrenegotiating committee  we don  t want to take any hasty decision   deshmukh\\nsaidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its\\nexpensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably  when\\npointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite\\nstate \\x0f 9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee  chief minister\\nsaid it was unfortunate \\nearlier  in his meeting with hazare  deshmukh promised to make necessary\\namendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so\\nthat the information was easily accessed by the common people  he also gave a\\npatient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state\\ndepartments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry\\nwithin three months \\nafternoon  april 27  2001\\n enron  s on  \\nstate govt  to renegotiate dabhol power project  by hubert vaz\\nthe us power giant  enron power corporation  s willingness to wrap up the\\ndabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise \\nthough the dabhol power company chief  mr  wade cline  has been authorised to\\ndo so  since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the\\nmatter \\ndisclosing this  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that\\nthe state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power\\nproject at dabhol could be continued  and at the same time enron did not feel\\nslighted   enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision  we are\\nwaiting for their letter   he said  when asked what sort of compromise the\\nstate government plans to forge  mr  deshmukh said   let our officers come\\nback  after that we will decide a future course of action  but we are\\ndefinitely going in for renegotiation of the project  it is very difficult to\\npredict the outcome of enron  s decision but as of now the project is still\\non   when asked whether the project could be moved to another state  if wound\\nup from maharashtra  mr  deshmukh said  that was not possible as per the\\nterms of the agreement between the us company and the state government \\nhowever  it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself  he\\nindicated  he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses\\nif the project was terminated \\nthe board of directors of the dabhol power company  which met in london on\\nwednesday  decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project\\nonce and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project  if he\\ndeemed it fit  however  this decision  as of now  does not necessarily\\nindicate the death knell for the project  the enron project  which had been\\nriddled with controversies right from its inception  had been a pretext for\\nthe political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to\\ntime  the previous sena  bjp government  which had been out to terminate the\\nproject  however  chose to continue with it following renegotiations with\\nenron  s top visiting officials like ms  rebecca mark  and  the democratic\\nfront government inherited the controversial project when the governments\\nchanged hands a year and a half ago \\nmeanwhile  state energy minister dr  padamsinh patil  when contacted at the\\nosmanabad circuit house  said the state government and the central government\\nhave decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with\\nenron   it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that \\nthey will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both\\nsides   he said  in case the project is terminated  the government can still\\nmanage the power needs of the state  though it would be a bit tough job  he\\nadded '"

journal\\nal 8\\n copyright  c  2001  dow jones in particular  our role as auditors of year  end financial statements presented by management  we invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year to improve our audit capabilities  train our people and enhance quality \\nwhen a client fails  we study what happened  from top to bottom  to learn important lessons and do better  we are doing that with enron  we are cooperating fully with investigations into enron  if we have made mistakes  we will acknowledge them  if we need to make changes  we will  we are very clear about our responsibilities  what we do is important  so is getting it right \\nenron has admitted that it made some bad investments  was over  leveraged  and authorized dealings that undermined the confidence of investors  credit  rating agencies  and trading counter  parties  enron  s trading business and its revenue streams collapsed  leading to bankruptcy \\nif lessons are to be learned from enron  a range of broader issues need to be addressed  among them \\n  rethinking some of our accounting standards  like the tax code  our accounting rules and literature have grown in volume and complexity as we have attempted to turn an art into a science  in the process  we have fostered a technical  legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with the form rather than the substance of what is reported \\nenron provides a good example of how such orthodoxy can make it harder for investors to appreciate what  s going on in a business  like many companies today  enron used sophisticated financing vehicles known as special purpose entities  spes  and other off  balance  sheet structures  such vehicles permit companies  like enron  to increase leverage without having to report debt on their balance sheet  wall street has helped companies raise billions with these structured financings  which are well known to analysts and investors \\nas the rules stand today  sponsoring companies can keep the assets and liabilities of spes off their consolidated financial statements  even though they retain a majority of the related risks and rewards  basing the accounting rules on a risk  reward concept would give investors more information about the consolidated entity  s financial position by having more of the assets and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet  certainly more information than disclosure alone could ever provide  the profession has been debating how to account for spes for many years  it  s time to rethink the rules \\n  modernizing our broken financial  reporting model  enron  s collapse  like the dot  com meltdown  is a reminder that our financial  reporting model   with its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings  per  share number   is out of date and unresponsive to today  s new business models  complex financial structures  and associated business risks \\nenron disclosed reams of information  including an eight  page management  s discussion  analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report  some analysts studied these  sold short and made profits  but other sophisticated analysts and fund managers have said that  although they were confused  they bought and lost money \\nwe need to fix this problem  we can  t long maintain trust in our capital markets with a financial  reporting system that delivers volumes of complex information about what happened in the past  but leaves some investors with limited understanding of what  s happening at the present and what is likely to occur in the future \\nthe current financial  reporting system was created in the 1930 s for the industrial age  that was a time when assets were tangible and investors were sophisticated and few  there were no derivatives  no structured off  balance  sheet financings  no instant stock quotes or mutual funds  no first call estimates  and no lou dobbs or cnbc \\nwe need to move quickly but carefully to a more dynamic and richer reporting model  disclosurs needs to be continuous  not periodic  to reflect today  s 24  7 capital markets  we need to provide several streams of relevant information  we need to expand the number of key performance indicators  beyond earnings per share  to present the information investors really need to understand a company  s business model and its business risks  financial structure and operating performance \\n  reforming our patchwork regulatory environment  an alphabet soup of institutions   from the aicpa  american institute of certified public accountants  to the sec and the asb  auditing standards board   eitf  emerging issues task force  and fasb  financial accounting standards board  to the pob  public oversight board    all have important roles in our profession  s regulatory framework  they are all made up of smart  diligent  well  intentioned people  but the system is not keeping up with the issues raised by today  s complex financial issues  standard  setting is too slow  responsibility for administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession \\nall of us must focus on ways to improve the system  agencies need more resources and experts  processes need to be redesigned  the accounting profession needs to acknowledge concerns about our system of discipline and peer review  and address them  some criticisms are off the mark  but some are well deserved  for our part  we intend to work constructively with the sec  congress  the accounting profession and others to make the changes needed to put these concerns to rest \\n  improving accountability across our capital system  unfortunately  we have witnessed much of this before  two years ago  scores of new economy companies soared to irrational values then collapsed in dust as investors came to question their business models and prospects  the dot  com bubble cost investors trillions  it  s time to get serious about the lessons it taught us \\nin particular  we need to consider the responsibilities and accountability of all players in the system as we review what happened at enron and the broader issues it raises  millions of individuals now depend in large measure on the integrity and stability of our capital markets for personal wealth and security \\nof course  investors look to management  directors and accountants  but they also count on investment bankers to structure financial deals in the best interest of the company and its shareholders  they trust analysts who recommend stocks and fund managers who buy on their behalf to do their homework   and walk away from companies they don  t understand  they count on bankers and credit agencies to dig deep  for our system to work in today  s complex economy  these checks and balances must function properly \\nenron reminds us that the system can and must be improved  we are prepared to do our part \\n  \\nmr  berardino is managing

profile as this will attract senior management  s attention for some time   said robert grossman  chief credit officer with debt  rating agency fitch inc   which has had dynegy on its credit watch since dynegy agreed to the merger   the very fact that the lawsuit is out there poses risk in some investors  minds and it could limit the upper end of the stock for awhile   says ronald barone  an analyst with ubs warburg \\nstill  dynegy is aggressively trying to build up its energy  trading business  dynegy  s president and chief operating officer  steve bergstrom  who worked for enron in the

operations \\nas enron was cratering last week  dynegy swiftly moved to capitalize on enron  s sudden inability to provide enough credit security for natural  gas  supply deals  as enron traders scrambled to match buyers and sellers and disgorge its obligations for delivering gas to its customers   dynegy was a direct beneficiary   an enron trader said yesterday   when we couldn  t do it  people just thought  let  s go across the street and talk to dynegy    he said dynegy was offering the best deals late last week \\nsince oct  1  the number of customers executing agreements on

flight to quality by customers   he said   we will not be distracted by these events  \\nmany enron traders are said to be upset with management for the implosion of the company   these traders are

chapter 11 bankruptcy filing marks the beginning of complicated jockeying as hundreds of creditors seek to get the most they can at the expense of other creditors \\nfilings expected to be submitted to the court subsequent to enron  s original petition sunday will at least partially lift the veil of secrecy that has long hovered over the company  s dealings  but for now  few of enron  s many unsecured creditors have any idea how much they can hope to recover  thanks to enron  s complex structure and the huge liabilities that were tucked away in partnerships not consolidated onto the company  s balance sheet \\nin its chapter 11 filing  enron corp  listed  13  15 billion in debt  when combined with obligations of its 13 subsidiaries also in bankruptcy proceedings  on  balance  sheet debt totals  31  24 billion  some bankers who are involved estimate the parent company has an additional  27 billion in off  balance  sheet and contingent liabilities  the combined list of creditors attached to enron  s bankruptcy filing is 54 pages long \\nprecisely because there are so many claims  the contesting among enron  s creditors is expected to be especially fierce  while bankruptcy law specifies a clear ranking of claims   with senior secured creditors at the top of the pyramid  the mass of unsecured claims beneath them and equity holders at the bottom   bankruptcy proceedings aren  t always set in stone \\n chapter 11 is the only place in the legal system where you can alter the rights of one creditor against another and alter the distribution of losses   said stephen case  a bankruptcy lawyer with davis polk wardell in new york \\nin coming weeks  enron will file other legal documents that will be widely scrutinized by creditors and potential vulture investors  who buy distressed debt  for information about the ultimate value of the company \\nuntil now  many distressed  debt players have been on the sidelines  citing the impossibility of understanding enron  s business operations  the extent of its liabilities and the possibility that its financial records contain misstatements beyond the restatements announced last month by enron \\n traditionally  immediately after a bankruptcy filing  a flurry of opportunistic investors will look at the company   said edward tillinghast  a bankruptcy lawyer with coudert brothers in new york   it is easier to analyze after bankruptcy because so much more information becomes available  \\n after a filing  the paper tends to get concentrated   added mr  case of davis polk   many institutional investors have to dump their securities because they don  t want to be seen in  or aren  t allowed to hold  defaulted paper  so they call the vulture funds and ask them to take it off their hands  \\ncomplicating the negotiations  claimants and creditors are a varied lot with diverse interests  reflecting enron  s combination of physical and financial assets   thousands and thousands of financial contracts  whose value is uncertain and likely to be highly contentious \\nusually  it is the unsecured creditors who compete most intensely for a share of the assets  in order to compete  the savviest creditors  such as the distressed  debt funds  which usually acquire debt positions at discounted prices  engage in a variety of strategies  for instance  they may threaten senior classes with the specter of a long drawn  out legal battle unless concessions are made  or  because each class of creditors gets to vote on any settlement  one party may buy up others  claims in order to control just over a third of the debt of that class   enough to influence the entire outcome \\ncopyright  2000 dow jones  company  inc  all rights reserved \\nauditor andersen is added to enron 401

2001\\nthe wall street journal\\ncl\\n copyright  c  2001  dow jones  company  inc  \\nwith their industry  s pioneer in bankruptcy court  the legions of energy companies that followed enron  s lead into the go  go world of commodity trading are finding their own profits and accounting practices under scrutiny as well \\nwhat ultimately triggered the collapse of investor confidence in enron were its indecipherable disclosures for related  party transactions  compounded by its admitted financial misstatements and massive off  balance  sheet liabilities  but many critics say disclosure issues of a different sort dog the financial statements of most companies that trade electricity  natural gas and the like   with the approval of the nation  s accounting  rule makers \\nat issue is a technique called  mark to market  accounting  under which the financial accounting standards board has given energy traders wide discretion to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize in future periods from energy  related contracts and other derivative instruments \\nfor many energy  trading companies  significant chunks of earnings in recent years have come from recording unrealized  noncash gains through such accounting entries  often  these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors  details of which the companies don  t provide  and because of the minimal disclosure standards  it is difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive  or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions   and force earnings revisions \\n whenever there  s a considerable amount of discretion that companies have in reporting their earnings  one gets concerned that some companies may overstate those earnings in certain situations where they feel pressure to make earnings goals   says abn amro analyst paul patterson  who follows energy  trading firms \\nmark  to  market accounting is required whenever companies have outstanding energy  related contracts on their balance sheets  either as assets or liabilities  at the end of a quarter  for example  these could be agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over time at certain prices  under the rules  companies estimate the fair values of the contracts  quarterly changes in value   representing unrealized  noncash gains and losses   then are run through the companies  income statements \\none way to gauge the size of some companies  past unrealized gains is to dig through their cash  flow statements  which sometimes specify the noncash portion of trading gains  at enron  unrealized trading gains accounted for slightly more than half of the company  s  1  41 billion of originally reported pretax profit in 2000 and about a third of its originally reported pretax profit of  1  13 billion in 1999 \\nat dynegy  unrealized gains accounted for nearly half its  762 million in 2000 pretax profit and about half its  227 million in 1999 pretax profit  dynegy executives say there isn  t anything wrong with the quality of their company  s earnings  and they point to financial reports for the first nine months of 2001 showing that none of the company  s reported earnings for this year came from unrealized gains \\nother energy traders whose earnings have been boosted in recent years by mark  to  market gains include american electric power  duke energy  el paso  entergy  mirant  pinnacle west capital and williams cos \\nhow much discretion do energy traders have in valuing their contracts  the rule  pretty much  is that there aren  t many rules \\nfor instance  during a conference last week sponsored by the fasb and the american accounting association  attendees were shown a hypothetical example under which the fair value of a power contract could range from  40 million to  153 million  depending on which assumptions of future trends were used \\nand the mark  to  market rules that do exist for energy contracts were crafted in large part on approaches that enron and other traders lobbied for   we developed those rules   enron  s chief accounting officer  richard causey  said in an august interview \\nover the past three years  members of the fasb  s emerging issues task force have extensively debated the subject of how to value energy  related contracts  what they have decided is that companies should be left to their own discretion  though the task force recognizes that could create problems  in a june 2000 report  for instance  the group noted that two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energy contracts  resulting in widely different valuations   those differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value   the report said \\nthe task force  s chairman  tim lucas  says it simply is too difficult to draft a one  size  fits  all solution   there  s no one way to do it  there are various models  and we think it requires professional judgment to assess   further  he says  requiring companies to disclose all the estimates underlying their earnings would produce disclosures so voluminous that they would be of little value \\nthat is in line with the industry  s longtime position  in a june 2000 letter to mr  lucas  for instance  mr  causey said  the valuation process should be determined by individual companies   and the task force  should not address the valuation methodology for energy or energy related contracts  \\nin its financial filings  dynegy explains that when market  price quotes aren  t available for certain long  term contracts   the lack of long  term pricing liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments   as a result  actual cash returns may  vary  either positively or negatively  from the results estimated  \\nquoted market prices offering independent guidance on many short  term energy contracts have become more readily available in recent years  even then  there aren  t rules specifying which market quotes companies must use  for instance  should

chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee \\nall are vowing to get to the bottom of one of the most precipitous business reversals in history  and some members of congress say enron  s downfall  on the heels of california  s energy meltdown early this year  proves that washington must demand more disclosure from energy traders  holding them at least to the standards of wall street firms \\n  enron is the sequela to california  it  s all part of the one  year story line    said representative edward j  markey  democrat of massachusetts  who focuses on energy regulatory issues in the house    we can  t leave energy products in the regulatory shadows  it hurts both investors and consumers   \\nother influential officials are in no rush to turn back the clock on deregulation \\n  we have had a number of false starts  and it would be crazy not to take a look at the lessons we can learn    said nora brownell  one of president bush  s appointees this year to the federal energy regulatory commission    but we should not leap to the conclusion that competitive markets do not work   \\nthe bush administration  along with some democrats   including mr  bingaman and william massey  a democrat on the energy commission   continue to favor plans advanced by enron that would pry open regional electricity markets \\n  we have to look carefully at the causes of consequences of enron  s collapse    mr  bingaman said    but i don  t see anything in this that would keep us from moving ahead with open transmission access and these types of things   \\nthe durability of such views is a sign of how effective enron was during the last decade in keeping washington at bay as the company pushed to restructure the electricity industry and limit government oversight of new energy markets \\nenron and its employees were the largest contributors to president bush  s campaigns over the years  and enron gave more money to politicians in the last election cycle than did any other energy company  since 1993  its employees and its chairman  kenneth l  lay  have donated nearly  2 million to mr  bush  in the 2000 election cycle  more than  1 million was

financial instruments used by enron and other companies to trade energy contracts  mr  lay courted linda robertson  a senior treasury official who was the department  s liaison with congress \\nms  robertson twice accepted paid trips to talk with company executives while she was still employed at the treasury  her financial disclosure shows  the measure that became law  the commodity futures modernization act of 2000  specifically exempted energy trading from the regulatory scrutiny applied to brokers of money  securities and commodities \\nms  robertson  who became the head of enron  s washington office  did not return a phone call seeking comment \\nlast spring  when the bush administration drafted a new national energy policy  mr  lay had a 30  minute meeting with vice president dick cheney to discuss the report  the policy blueprint endorsed breaking up monopoly control of electricity transmission networks  an enron goal that was spelled out in a memorandum mr  lay discussed during his meeting with mr  cheney \\nenron also had an unusual opportunity to influence mr  bush  s choices for the federal energy regulatory commission  which oversees the markets in which enron operates  mr  lay met mr  bush  s personnel adviser  clay johnson  to discuss nominees  when mr  bush picked people to fill two vacant republican slots on the five  member commission  both had the

main challenger for influence in washington  the company has nurtured a loose coalition of southeast lawmakers   the senate minority leader  trent lott of mississippi  most prominent among them   in support of its view that the states should retain leeway in deciding the pace and scope of energy deregulation \\nso far this year  its political action committees have outspent all other energy companies  including enron and big oil companies like exxon mobil  in supporting members of congress  according to the u  s  public interest research group  southern strongly opposes efforts to diminish the power of local regulators to supervise electricity pricing  production and transmission \\n  we have long felt that enron  s vision of open markets does not work with electricity    said dwight evans  executive vice president of the southern company    i think our credibility has been enhanced by recent events   \\nmr  evans said that the federal energy regulatory commission under mr

unfettered competition are debating ways to reimpose regulatory control \\nenron  s assiduous efforts to keep its energy trading free of government interference could be another casualty of its collapse \\nas the value of energy contracts soared into the hundreds of billions of dollars   at one point up to half all electricity and natural gas transactions passed through enron  s trading operation  by some estimates   enron scrambled to hold off congress and regulators \\nbut some regulatory experts now say that enron  s collapse is reminiscent of the failure of long  term capital

of derivatives crumbled in late 1998 \\nwith its exemption from scrutiny in hand  enron revealed relatively little about its trading portfolio  leaving analysts guessing how it had made its profits  enron  s secrecy was one factor that caused investor confidence to plummet in recent weeks  after the company revealed some unorthodox financial arrangements that benefited top executives \\n  enron was getting very heavily into derivatives  and along with wall street banks  they went to bat to keep us away    said michael greenberger  who was director of trading and markets at the commodities

oversight of energy trading  he said regulators should begin requiring transparency from companies like enron  while examining the adequacy of their capital and the stability of their trading

profitable enterprise suddenly goes bankrupt  there are surely lessons to be learned  when that enterprise is the most admired company in america  lauded by business theorists as the quintessential 21 st  century corporation  one wonders if it is the tip of an iceberg  and how many of us have  without knowing it  booked passage on the titanic \\nit will take time  and many legal proceedings  before the full story of enron  s collapse becomes known  but one thing is already clear  the case shows how adept corporate executives have become at shifting risk away from themselves and onto others  in particular onto their employees  enron  s leaders have walked away from the debacle chastened but very  very rich  many of enron  s employees   no doubt including the loyalists who sent irate letters every time i criticized the company   have lost their life savings \\nbehind this disaster for ordinary workers lies a little  remarked sea change in america  s retirement system  twenty years ago most workers were in   defined benefit   plans   that is  their employers promised them a fixed pension  today most workers have   defined contribution   plans  they invest money for their retirement  and accept the risk that those investments might go bad  retirement contributions are normally subsidized by the employer  and receive special tax treatment  but all this is to no avail if  as happened at enron  the assets workers have bought lose most of their value \\nit  s easy to make the theoretical case for defined  contribution plans  such plans expand an employee  s choices  he can choose how much to save  and how to invest his money  and more choice is ordinarily good \\nbut the sad fate of enron  s employees highlights the difference between theory and practice  as gretchen morgenson of the times pointed out on sunday  workers across the country have been cajoled or coerced into holding a high proportion of their retirement assets in their employers  own stock  the exploitive nature of this financial incest was emphasized by enron  s now  notorious   lockdown    in which   purely by coincidence  say executives   new rules forced employees to remain invested in the company  s stock just as the firm began its death spiral  so much for freedom of choice \\nand even when employees have real choices  one wonders whether they fully appreciate the risks  the shift away from old  fashioned pensions coincided with an enormous bull market  surely many workers who have never seen stock prices fall since they became investors underestimate the risk of capital losses \\none hopes that corporate collapses will not become commonplace  still  it  s highly likely that millions of american workers will have near  enron experiences  learning to their dismay that big chunks of their retirement savings have evaporated  they will be left dependent on the one great defined  benefit program that remains  social security  that is  if it  s still around \\nthe bush administration  s commission on social security reform issued its latest report last week  just as enron entered its death throes  most of the criticism of that commission  s work  my own included  has focused on its  yes  enron  like accounting  items seem to migrate onto or off the balance sheet to suit the commission  s convenience  thus when the social security system takes in more money than it pays out  as it does at present  this has no significance   the federal budget is unified  you see  so it doesn  t mean anything when one particular piece of it is in surplus  but in 2016  when the social security system starts to pay out more than it takes in  there will be a crisis   social security  you see  must stand on its own \\nbut the commission resorts to bogus accounting only to make the case for its ultimate objective  to convert social security from a defined  benefit system  which guarantees retired americans a certain basic income  to a defined  contribution system  in which the unwise or unlucky can find themselves destitute in their old age \\nsome analysts i know think social security will be converted to a defined  contribution system  not because it is a good idea but because the financial industry   which has enormous clout in our money  driven political system   has so much to gain from the conversion  i hope they  re wrong  but if they are right  the fate of enron  s poor employees  victimized by a management team they thought was on their side  may truly be the shape of things to come \\ncopyright  2000 dow jones  company  inc  all rights

an amazing tale of corporate downfall and hubris  and it is providing lessons ranging from the mercilessness of markets to the dangers of forcing people to tie their living and retirement to the same company \\nenron  created in 1985 when houston natural gas combined with a gas  pipeline company  swaggered through the 1990 s  it claimed it would revolutionize life and commerce by substituting the efficient hand of the market for the clumsy hand of government regulation \\nbut enron  s leaders proved to be every bit as bungling as any government bureaucrat  sift through the financial debris  and you see that enron lost about  7 billion on four dumb investments  details below   however profitable enron  s other businesses might have been  paying for those turkeys stretched enron to the breaking point  and it broke  some  60 billion of stockholder value has been wiped out this year  shares that opened the year at  83 closed friday at 26 cents  bankruptcy looms  you wonder if enron field  home of the houston astros baseball team  will be renamed chapter 11 field  or maybe house of cards \\nadding another dimension to the debacle is the intimate relationship between enron and the white house  enron  which for years has tried to ride roughshod over state and federal regulators  has ties throughout the bush administration  for starters  enron and its chairman  kenneth lay  were among george w  bush  s biggest and most important contributors in his texas and presidential campaigns  and according to public records  bush intimates ranging from economic adviser larry lindsay to political adviser karl rove  who owned  100  000 to  250  000 of enron stock  to trade representative robert b  zoellick had been on enron  s payroll before moving to washington  army secretary thomas white jr   a former enron executive  had stock and options worth between  50 million and  100 million \\nin a different environment   remember whitewater    the combination of big losses and white house ties would have long since produced cries for a special prosecutor to see what  if anything  enron  s buddies have done on behalf of the company  the upcoming hearings in the republican  controlled house should be fascinating  and there will doubtless be more hearings in the democratic  controlled senate \\n we  ve had no contact with the white house  since enron  s meltdown started  says company spokesman mark palmer \\n i  m not aware that there have been any requests  from enron  for anything   a white house spokesman says \\neven though enron shareholders have been essentially wiped out  lay isn  t going to the poorhouse  unlike enron employees whose retirement accounts have been vaporized because they consisted largely of enron stock the company wouldn  t let them sell  lay has plenty of wealth left  last year alone  he made  123 million of profit on stock options  according to enron filings  this year he has made an additional  25 million or so  note  on friday  with its stock at around 30 cents  enron changed its policy and allowed employees to sell it \\nironically  what brought down enron from its lofty perch on the fortune 500 list  no  7  is that the markets  whose virtue it preached  lost faith in it after it disclosed funny dealings with a partnership run by its chief financial officer \\nand now  let  s proceed to the syllabus of enron 101 \\n1  bubbles didn  t end\\nwhen dot  coms bombed\\nenron  a major trader of electricity and natural gas  grossed  200 billion a year and had  60 billion of assets  but it turned out to be a bubble  its business depended on borrowing lots of money  people lined up to lend as long as enron seemed healthy  when suspicions arose six weeks ago after the company revealed its partnership problems  money trickled away  then it started leaving in a flood  as enron tottered  it lost trading business  its remaining customers began to gouge it   that  s how trading works in the real world  don  t blame the usual suspects  stock analysts  rather  blame arthur andersen  enron  s outside auditor  which didn  t blow the whistle until it was too late   andersen says it  s far too early for me to be drawing conclusions  \\n2  deregulation can be dangerous\\nit  s clear that the cozy world of utility monopolies needed to be shaken up  given huge losses on nuclear plants and other problems  besides  breakthroughs in turbine technology made it feasible for big users such as manufacturing plants to set up their own generators and drop off the electric grid  letting them go would have raised prices for everyone else  but dereg has caused lots of problems  in 1998  the midwest had huge spikes in the price of electricity and rolling blackouts  some utilities had sold power outside their service areas  and the traders they were relying on to replace that power didn  t deliver  upstarts have dropped in and out of retail markets in several states  sticking established players with big costs  and  of course  there  s california  which got caught with too little energy in the spring  helping enron and others make big profits  and now is stuck with too much expensive energy  this has crippled the state  s finances  driven its biggest utility into bankruptcy and clobbered customers  leaving vital necessities such as electricity and natural gas to the tender mercies of the market is risky  especially when a big player such as enron can vanish overnight \\n3  beware your own hype\\nenron pioneered trading in electricity and natural gas  and it was the primo player in that field  but it came to believe that it was good at everything  it wasn  t  some of the debacles  losses of  2 billion each in the water and telecommunications businesses  and another  2 billion lost in a brazilian utility investment  it blew an additional  1 billion on an electricity  generating plant in india  hence  i think  the need to obscure rising debt levels and less  than  stellar results by dealing with so  called off  balance  sheet partnerships with  star wars  names such as jedi  for joint energy development investments  and chewco  as in chewbacca  the wookiee   the fact that enron executives were involved in these partnerships and made money while the company got clocked didn  t help \\nthe summary\\nthe enron affair reinforces two of the oldest lessons there are  to wit  when

 but the biggest stockbroking outfits are owned by investment banks that also do other types of business  advising companies on mergers  helping them to issue shares or bonds  these advisory businesses create a conflict of interest  in order to cultivate corporations that may hire them  banks are reluctant to allow their stock analysts to issue sell recommendations on their stock  the  chinese walls  that are supposed to guarantee analysts  objectivity by separating them from other parts of their banks are ineffective  and sometimes nonexistent  in some banks  stock analysts who are supposedly working in investors  interests are also expected to work on corporate advisory projects \\nthis kind of conflict may explain why many analysts continued to recommend enron  s stock just a few days before the company  s bankruptcy  in one unfortunate case  lehman brothers rated enron a  strong buy  as it headed toward disaster  it may or may not be coincidental that lehman was in line to earn a large fee for advising on the takeover of enron   a takeover that fell through partly as a result of falls in enron  s stock price \\na similar conflict of interest plagues audit firms  auditors are supposed to serve investors by certifying the accuracy of companies  financial statements  but auditors also earn consulting fees when they advise companies on information technology and other management issues  the desire to win consulting contracts may reduce auditors  appetite for dust  ups with companies whose accounts seem suspicious  enron  s auditor  arthur andersen  earned  27 million in consulting fees from the company last year   slightly more than the  25 million it got paid to audit enron  s books  at the same time it failed to challenge enron  s habit of hiding some of its dicier business in partnerships that went unreported on the balance sheet \\nthe conflicts of interest at stockbrokers and auditors  while similar  demand different remedies  investors themselves are in a position to correct some of the stockbroker problem  they can ignore advice from analysts at the integrated investment banks  and route their business through smaller independent stockbrokers  but the auditor conflicts need to be fixed by regulators at the securities and exchange commission  the commission  s last chairman  arthur levitt  took a tough line with the auditors  his successor  harvey pitt  has struck a softer tone  with luck  mr  pitt will now adopt more of his predecessor  s outlook  without objective auditing  there will be more and more enrons   and more and more

outages and extra demand from holiday light displays  energy officials warned \\nbut the state  s relatively new power  buying operation would be up to the task of lining up any extra electricity that might be needed for enron  s customers  officials said  they just want as much notification as possible to avoid the frightening shortfalls of last winter and spring  when power buyers frantically scoured the west by phone to scare up any available megawatt to prevent rolling blackouts \\n if the entire amount was dumped back on the grid without giving the grid time to absorb it  that would not be such a good thing   said pete garris  acting deputy director in charge of the california department of water resources  power  buying division \\nenron is believed to supply as much as 1  400 megawatts of electricity demand by institutional and industrial customers in california  including the university of california and california state university systems  that is equivalent to the usage

customers of southern california edison  pacific gas  electric and san diego gas  electric  a severe cash crunch and the collapse of the state  s primary power market left those utilities without the

california  where utilities no longer buy additional power for their customers and regulators have ended the program that allows new customers to pick an electricity provider other than the traditional utility  if enron were to drop customers  they would revert to their former utility  and any extra power would have to be supplied by the state  said terrie prosper  a spokeswoman for the california public utilities commission \\n i don  t think it would be a problem   she said   it  s not like a whole city coming online all at once  \\nin a signal that enron is already pulling back

hassell\\ncopyright 2001 houston chronicle\\nas recently as two months ago  enron executives were toasting their decision back in 1999 to plunk down  100 million for the naming rights for houston  s gleaming baseball park \\nbuying the name enron field had done wonders for the ambitious company  s quest of making a name for itself across the nation and around the world  without a doubt  they said  it was worth every penny of the  3  3 million they agreed to pay the houston astros every season for 30 years \\nbut the past 60 days have been a nightmare for the high  tech energy company  with alarming speed  enron has collapsed and is fighting for its survival \\nwith its future in peril  one of the many uncertainties surrounding enron is the identity of its glitzy namesake perched on the eastern edge of downtown \\nwhen baseball fans file into the stadium for the astros  season opener april 2  will the enormous blue letters spelling enron field still loom large over the centerfield scoreboard \\n if you were to ask me the question today  it will be called enron field on april 2   said pam gardner  the astros  president of business operations   but there is so much that could happen  every day could bring a new twist to this deal     we are waiting to see how this plays out  \\nfor now  enron is paid up on its financial obligations to the astros  the baseball club declined to say when the next payment is due  or how large  the team also declined to say what action it might take if enron fails to deliver the cash on time \\nfor its part  enron officials are saying little about the stadium deal  which is relatively small fry when you consider that the company is embroiled in the largest chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in history \\n it  s like every other pre  petition claim   enron spokesman mark palmer said   it will become a matter for the bankruptcy judge  \\nenron field is but one of the many new stadiums experiencing an identity crisis  in baltimore  the super bowl champion ravens play football in a stadium named after a bankrupt internet service provider  but as beleagured as the company is  it has not yet missed a payment  and the place is still called psinet stadium \\nin st  louis  the rams play football in a dome that had been named after twa  but american airlines bought out the carrier  and the twa name has been removed from the stadium \\nthe rams haven  t found another company willing to pony up millions  so the stadium bears the temporary monicker of dome at america  s center \\nas dull as that name is  it  s probably better than what you  ll find in miami  where the dolphins and marlins play in something called pro player stadium  the biggest problem with that is there  s no sportswear company called pro player anymore  it has vanished  although the stadium name remains the same \\nin past naming  rights deals  the heaviest buyers have been high  tech outfits and airlines  both of those industries are in the tank  and it seems unlikely we  ll see any big deals coming from those quarters anytime soon \\n it is a period of uncertainty   said todd gruen  managing editor of a publication called naming rights deals   once we get a handle on where the economy is going  the naming rights industry can find its place as well  \\njust how difficult finding a sponsor can be during this recession is underscored by the experience of the texas rangers \\nthe team  s multimillionaire owner  tom hicks  is hunting for a sponsor to buy the naming rights to what is now called the ballpark at arlington  so far  hicks and the rangers have struck out looking \\n in our weakened economy  everything is kind of on hold   rangers president jim lites told the fort worth star  telegram recently \\nso if enron backs away from the stadium that was to bear its name for the next 28 years  the astros will be hard pressed to quickly find a new corporate partner to fill the void \\n i am guessing it will stay enron field for a while   gruen said \\nin addition to the weak economy and the glut of stadiums chasing after deep  pocketed sponsors  the economics of baseball may be a spooky proposition for companies looking to use the national pastime to buy some goodwill \\nwith no labor contract in place between the owners and the players  the specter of another work stoppage looms over the game  if that weren  t bad enough  baseball  s own commissioner says the game is bleeding  500 million a year  and he is seeking to shut down two franchises before the season starts this spring \\n this uncertainty doesn  t come at a good time for the astros   said dean bonham  chairman of the sports marketing concern called the bonham group   major league baseball is on the precipice of a disaster  it is almost assured there will be a work stoppage in the next two seasons  i would categorize the impact of a work stoppage as catastrophic     baseball is in serious turmoil  \\ngruen takes a less alarmist view of baseball  s future but agrees that prospective sponsors  will probably want to wait until this labor situation is resolved  \\nwhich is not all bad  gruen thinks the very worst thing the astros could do is jump

2001 houston chronicle\\nnew york   enron corp  took steps monday to ensure funding for its day  to  day operations  but the company faces a difficult struggle in the months ahead as it tries rebuild itself \\nin new york monday  u  s  bankruptcy court judge arthur gonzalez approved a plan for a group of lenders led by j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup to lend enron  250 million now  another  250 million by jan  7 and  if all goes well  another  1 billion after that \\nthe goal is to ensure that enron  s core energy trading business survives as a viable entity  by giving other companies confidence they can still do business with enron and expect to be paid \\nenron officials estimate its trading business alone is worth  6 billion to  7 billion  said martin bienenstock  an attorney with weil  gotshal  manges  representing enron in the bankruptcy case \\nenron currently has about  500 million in cash on hand  down from about  2  5 billion it typically had on hand before its crisis began  bienenstock said \\nenron may never need to dip into that extra  1  5 billion in cash  bienenstock said  but just having the funds available eases its financial stress \\n if we don  t get this credit  we may need it tomorrow   bienenstock told the court monday   if we do get it  we may never need it  \\nlenders who make such financing in a bankruptcy proceeding typically get high priority for repayment and their loans come with high interest rates and high underwriting fees \\nenron chief executive officer ken lay  who didn  t attend monday  s hearing  said in a statement the  250 million will be used to help enron fulfill obligations needed to run its business  such as employee payroll and vendor payments for goods and services provided on or after sunday  s bankruptcy filing \\nenron also is negotiating with three financial institutions in the hopes of revitalizing its wholesale trading business under a new ownership structure  bienenstock expects those talks to be completed within weeks \\ngonzalez also signed off on a provision to let enron pay up to  4  500 in severance pay to workers being laid off  workers could get additional severance payments later as the bankruptcy progresses \\na small number of employees may be eligible for up to  15  000 to cover travel and other expenses incurred but not reimbursed before enron sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the u  s  bankruptcy code \\nenron also will be allowed to keep making payments on its  219 million office tower that  s still under construction in downtown houston  enron has already paid  180 million toward the construction costs and any buyer of the property would need to complete the work to realize any value from the project \\njeff mcmahon  enron  s chief financial officer  was the company  s top executive at the hearing   i  m extremely disappointed to have to be here at all   he said during a break in the session \\nas the bankruptcy progresses  enron and its creditors will examine the various parts of the company and decide whether they would be more valuable being sold off or kept as ongoing operations \\nenron  s major creditors will meet on dec  12 to form a creditors committee  which will negotiate with the company on behalf of those still owed money  enron officials will be back in bankruptcy court for another hearing on dec  14 \\nenron  s chapter 11 filing is the largest bankruptcy case in u  s  corporate history  not surprisingly  gonzalez  s courtroom was packed monday with more than 125 attorneys and reporters \\nenron and 13 of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors after a planned merger with dynegy fell apart and cuts in enron  s credit rating triggered serious problems for the company \\nenron listed assets of  49  8 billion and liabilities of  31  2 billion  though it has other debt obligations not listed on the filings \\nas enron decided where to file  it probably considered that houston and new york have among the nation  s most sophisticated bankruptcy judges and lawyers in the country  said nancy rapoport  dean of the university of houston law center and a bankruptcy specialist \\nchoosing new york  she said  let enron avoid local issues hovering around the courthouse  and that includes current or laid  off enron workers \\nmonday  s hearing was just the first step in a process that could take a year or more  despite enron  s statements that it plans to emerge from bankruptcy protection with a rebuilt business of some type  the odds do not favor it \\n it  s challenging  but not impossible   said rapoport   a lot has to go right  \\neighty percent to 90 percent of companies will fail in their chapter 11 efforts  said jack williams  a law professor at the georgia state university college of law and scholar  in  residence at the american bankruptcy institute  a nonprofit think tank \\nthose that fail   even those that go in intending to reorganize   typically end up liquidating all their assets either in the chapter 11 proceeding or converting to a chapter 7 liquidation case  he said \\nthe biggest potential obstacles to success  a too  small asset base  not enough cash and a poor business plan  he said \\nas a case unfolds  it  s not uncommon for the true value of a company  s assets to turn out below the company  s numbers  williams said \\nsome companies actually file for chapter 11  even though they intend to liquidate assets  experts said  as doing so gives them more control over a selloff  under a chapter 7 filing  a court  appointed trustee handles the liquidation \\nbefore it filed  enron had put much of its portfolio of international assets up for sale  any deals now need approval from the court  with proceeds going to creditors \\nthe creditors committee has a voice in virtually everything that is considered by the judge  said joel kay  an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy cases at hughes  watters  askanase l  l  p  in houston \\nthat includes an opinion on whatever reorganization plan enron files with the court \\nonce a bankruptcy petition is made  the company cannot pay any debts incurred before the filing without permission from the judge  kay said \\nenron is expected to immediately start sorting through its leases and contracts  deciding what it needs to run the business and what is not needed \\nfor those the judge agrees to let enron keep  it will be allowed to make payments for future goods and services  companies with contracts enron is allowed to reject will be considered creditors \\nenron does not need court approval to spend money on what is considered the normal course of business  but if it wants to sell assets  borrow money or do something out of the ordinary  it must ask \\nfor example  if enron reaches a plan to revamp its trading operation  the court will need to approve \\nseveral stock analysts expressed doubt that enron will come out of chapter 11 or be able to make its trading operation work again  even if a new trading joint venture is created \\nandre meade of commerzbank securities in new york said buyers and sellers of energy  are not going to come back to this new entity in droves  \\n i  m having a hard time thinking of a scenario where you can actually get a workable entity out of this chapter 11   he said   it  s going to be hard for them to reorganize around anything  they may not emerge from chapter 11  \\nhe expects shareholders   generally at the bottom of the creditor pool in a bankruptcy filing   will most likely get nothing out of the bankruptcy filing \\nthe efforts of shareholders and employees who sued enron will be delayed or halted \\nsuch lawsuits are stayed and attorneys will have to seek permission of the bankruptcy court to move ahead \\ndec  4  2001\\nhouston chronicle\\nq  a on the enron bankruptcy\\nwhy did enron file for bankruptcy \\nenron  s increasing problems   particularly the reduction in its bond rating to junk bond status   triggered billions in claims that it could not afford to pay  filing for bankruptcy protection allows it to avoid paying creditors while it works out a plan to reorganize the company \\nhow will the company fund its day  to  day business going forward \\nthe two top priorities now are finding a source of financing for its day  to  day operations and getting permission from the bankruptcy court to pay essential expenses   such as their payroll and the cost of benefits like health insurance \\nat this point why would anyone lend them another penny \\nafter filing for bankruptcy companies normally seek what is known as debtor  in  possession financing  lenders that provide such financing go to the front of the line when it comes time to get paid back  this agreement  which normally pays a top interest rate  has to be approved by other creditors  the creditors normally go along because continued operations will mean a bigger payout than a complete liquidation \\nwho will get paid back \\nbankruptcy law sets the priorities in a bankruptcy  first in line are those with debts secured by the company  s property  at the bottom are common shareholders  in the middle are unsecured creditors  however  this is all subject to negotiation by the committees representing the parties in the suit \\nif common shareholders are the last to get paid  why did the stock rise \\nthere  s no good explanation  sometimes at the start of a big case  certain parties will buy shares to win a place on the committee representing shareholders  other buyers are traders who see a short  term profit to be made in the price movement of the stock  which trades in pennies \\nwill enron be able to come back \\nthat depends on whether management can pare this once huge company down to a profitable core  officials within enron have warned the surviving company may be far different than what you see today  often many operations are sold to raise cash to preserve a few key parts \\ndec  4  2001  11  23 pm\\nhouston chronicle\\nenron  s recent troubles\\naug  14\\njeff skilling  who served as ceo for six months  steps down for personal reasons  ken lay

journal\\nal 8\\n copyright  c  2001  dow jones in particular  our role as auditors of year  end financial statements presented by management  we invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year to improve our audit capabilities  train our people and enhance quality \\nwhen a client fails  we study what happened  from top to bottom  to learn important lessons and do better  we are doing that with enron  we are cooperating fully with investigations into enron  if we have made mistakes  we will acknowledge them  if we need to make changes  we will  we are very clear about our responsibilities  what we do is important  so is getting it right \\nenron has admitted that it made some bad investments  was over  leveraged  and authorized dealings that undermined the confidence of investors  credit  rating agencies  and trading counter  parties  enron  s trading business and its revenue streams collapsed  leading to bankruptcy \\nif lessons are to be learned from enron  a range of broader issues need to be addressed  among them \\n  rethinking some of our accounting standards  like the tax code  our accounting rules and literature have grown in volume and complexity as we have attempted to turn an art into a science  in the process  we have fostered a technical  legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with the form rather than the substance of what is reported \\nenron provides a good example of how such orthodoxy can make it harder for investors to appreciate what  s going on in a business  like many companies today  enron used sophisticated financing vehicles known as special purpose entities  spes  and other off  balance  sheet structures  such vehicles permit companies  like enron  to increase leverage without having to report debt on their balance sheet  wall street has helped companies raise billions with these structured financings  which are well known to analysts and investors \\nas the rules stand today  sponsoring companies can keep the assets and liabilities of spes off their consolidated financial statements  even though they retain a majority of the related risks and rewards  basing the accounting rules on a risk  reward concept would give investors more information about the consolidated entity  s financial position by having more of the assets and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet  certainly more information than disclosure alone could ever provide  the profession has been debating how to account for spes for many years  it  s time to rethink the rules \\n  modernizing our broken financial  reporting model  enron  s collapse  like the dot  com meltdown  is a reminder that our financial  reporting model   with its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings  per  share number   is out of date and unresponsive to today  s new business models  complex financial structures  and associated business risks \\nenron disclosed reams of information  including an eight  page management  s discussion  analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report  some analysts studied these  sold short and made profits  but other sophisticated analysts and fund managers have said that  although they were confused  they bought and lost money \\nwe need to fix this problem  we can  t long maintain trust in our capital markets with a financial  reporting system that delivers volumes of complex information about what happened in the past  but leaves some investors with limited understanding of what  s happening at the present and what is likely to occur in the future \\nthe current financial  reporting system was created in the 1930 s for the industrial age  that was a time when assets were tangible and investors were sophisticated and few  there were no derivatives  no structured off  balance  sheet financings  no instant stock quotes or mutual funds  no first call estimates  and no lou dobbs or cnbc \\nwe need to move quickly but carefully to a more dynamic and richer reporting model  disclosurs needs to be continuous  not periodic  to reflect today  s 24  7 capital markets  we need to provide several streams of relevant information  we need to expand the number of key performance indicators  beyond earnings per share  to present the information investors really need to understand a company  s business model and its business risks  financial structure and operating performance \\n  reforming our patchwork regulatory environment  an alphabet soup of institutions   from the aicpa  american institute of certified public accountants  to the sec and the asb  auditing standards board   eitf  emerging issues task force  and fasb  financial accounting standards board  to the pob  public oversight board    all have important roles in our profession  s regulatory framework  they are all made up of smart  diligent  well  intentioned people  but the system is not keeping up with the issues raised by today  s complex financial issues  standard  setting is too slow  responsibility for administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession \\nall of us must focus on ways to improve the system  agencies need more resources and experts  processes need to be redesigned  the accounting profession needs to acknowledge concerns about our system of discipline and peer review  and address them  some criticisms are off the mark  but some are well deserved  for our part  we intend to work constructively with the sec  congress  the accounting profession and others to make the changes needed to put these concerns to rest \\n  improving accountability across our capital system  unfortunately  we have witnessed much of this before  two years ago  scores of new economy companies soared to irrational values then collapsed in dust as investors came to question their business models and prospects  the dot  com bubble cost investors trillions  it  s time to get serious about the lessons it taught us \\nin particular  we need to consider the responsibilities and accountability of all players in the system as we review what happened at enron and the broader issues it raises  millions of individuals now depend in large measure on the integrity and stability of our capital markets for personal wealth and security \\nof course  investors look to management  directors and accountants  but they also count on investment bankers to structure financial deals in the best interest of the company and its shareholders  they trust analysts who recommend stocks and fund managers who buy on their behalf to do their homework   and walk away from companies they don  t understand  they count on bankers and credit agencies to dig deep  for our system to work in today  s complex economy  these checks and balances must function properly \\nenron reminds us that the system can and must be improved  we are prepared to do our part \\n  \\nmr  berardino is managing

profile as this will attract senior management  s attention for some time   said robert grossman  chief credit officer with debt  rating agency fitch inc   which has had dynegy on its credit watch since dynegy agreed to the merger   the very fact that the lawsuit is out there poses risk in some investors  minds and it could limit the upper end of the stock for awhile   says ronald barone  an analyst with ubs warburg \\nstill  dynegy is aggressively trying to build up its energy  trading business  dynegy  s president and chief operating officer  steve bergstrom  who worked for enron in the early 1980 s  is considered one of the brightest lights in energy trading and dynegy has been moving to bulk up its base of pipelines  production and power  plant capacity to complement its trading operations \\nas enron was cratering last week  dynegy swiftly moved to capitalize on enron  s sudden inability to provide enough credit security for natural  gas  supply deals  as enron traders scrambled to match buyers and sellers and disgorge its obligations for delivering gas to its customers   dynegy was a direct beneficiary   an enron trader said yesterday   when we couldn  t do it  people just thought  let  s go across the street and talk to dynegy    he said dynegy was offering the best deals late last week \\nsince oct  1  the number of customers executing agreements on

flight to quality by customers   he said   we will not be distracted by these events  \\nmany enron traders are said to be upset with management for the implosion of the company   these traders are

chapter 11 bankruptcy filing marks the beginning of complicated jockeying as hundreds of creditors seek to get the most they can at the expense of other creditors \\nfilings expected to be submitted to the court subsequent to enron  s original petition sunday will at least partially lift the veil of secrecy that has long hovered over the company  s dealings  but for now  few of enron  s many unsecured creditors have any idea how much they can hope to recover  thanks to enron  s complex structure and the huge liabilities that were tucked away in partnerships not consolidated onto the company  s balance sheet \\nin its chapter 11 filing  enron corp  listed  13  15 billion in debt  when combined with obligations of its 13 subsidiaries also in bankruptcy proceedings  on  balance  sheet debt totals  31  24 billion  some bankers who are involved estimate the parent company has an additional  27 billion in off  balance  sheet and contingent liabilities  the combined list of creditors attached to enron  s bankruptcy filing is 54 pages long \\nprecisely because there are so many claims  the contesting among enron  s creditors is expected to be especially fierce  while bankruptcy law specifies a clear ranking of claims   with senior secured creditors at the top of the pyramid  the mass of unsecured claims beneath them and equity holders at the bottom   bankruptcy proceedings aren  t always set in stone \\n chapter 11 is the only place in the legal system where you can alter the rights of one creditor against another and alter the distribution of losses   said stephen case  a bankruptcy lawyer with davis polk wardell in new york \\nin coming weeks  enron will file other legal documents that will be widely scrutinized by creditors and potential vulture investors  who buy distressed debt  for information about the ultimate value of the company \\nuntil now  many distressed  debt players have been on the sidelines  citing the impossibility of understanding enron  s business operations  the extent of its liabilities and the possibility that its financial records contain misstatements beyond the restatements announced last month by enron \\n traditionally  immediately after a bankruptcy filing  a flurry of opportunistic investors will look at the company   said edward tillinghast  a bankruptcy lawyer with coudert brothers in new york   it is easier to analyze after bankruptcy because so much more information becomes available  \\n after a filing  the paper tends to get concentrated   added mr  case of davis polk   many institutional investors have to dump their securities because they don  t want to be seen in  or aren  t allowed to hold  defaulted paper  so they call the vulture funds and ask them to take it off their hands  \\ncomplicating the negotiations  claimants and creditors are a varied lot with diverse interests  reflecting enron  s combination of physical and financial assets   thousands and thousands of financial contracts  whose value is uncertain and likely to be highly contentious \\nusually  it is the unsecured creditors who compete most intensely for a share of the assets  in order to compete  the savviest creditors  such as the distressed  debt funds  which usually acquire debt positions at discounted prices  engage in a variety of strategies  for instance  they may threaten senior classes with the specter of a long drawn  out legal battle unless concessions are made  or  because each class of creditors gets to vote on any settlement  one party may buy up others  claims in order to control just over a third of the debt of that class   enough to influence the entire outcome \\ncopyright  2000 dow jones  company  inc  all rights reserved \\nauditor andersen is added to enron 401

2001\\nthe wall street journal\\ncl\\n copyright  c  2001  dow jones  company  inc  \\nwith their industry  s pioneer in bankruptcy court  the legions of energy companies that followed enron  s lead into the go  go world of commodity trading are finding their own profits and accounting practices under scrutiny as well \\nwhat ultimately triggered the collapse of investor confidence in enron were its indecipherable disclosures for related  party transactions  compounded by its admitted financial misstatements and massive off  balance  sheet liabilities  but many critics say disclosure issues of a different sort dog the financial statements of most companies that trade electricity  natural gas and the like   with the approval of the nation  s accounting  rule makers \\nat issue is a technique called  mark to market  accounting  under which the financial accounting standards board has given energy traders wide discretion to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize in future periods from energy  related contracts and other derivative instruments \\nfor many energy  trading companies  significant chunks of earnings in recent years have come from recording unrealized  noncash gains through such accounting entries  often  these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors  details of which the companies don  t provide  and because of the minimal disclosure standards  it is difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive  or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions   and force earnings revisions \\n whenever there  s a considerable amount of discretion that companies have in reporting their earnings  one gets concerned that some companies may overstate those earnings in certain situations where they feel pressure to make earnings goals   says abn amro analyst paul patterson  who follows energy  trading firms \\nmark  to  market accounting is required whenever companies have outstanding energy  related contracts on their balance sheets  either as assets or liabilities  at the end of a quarter  for example  these could be agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over time at certain prices  under the rules  companies estimate the fair values of the contracts  quarterly changes in value   representing unrealized  noncash gains and losses   then are run through the companies  income statements \\none way to gauge the size of some companies  past unrealized gains is to dig through their cash  flow statements  which sometimes specify the noncash portion of trading gains  at enron  unrealized trading gains accounted for slightly more than half of the company  s  1  41 billion of originally reported pretax profit in 2000 and about a third of its originally reported pretax profit of  1  13 billion in 1999 \\nat dynegy  unrealized gains accounted for nearly half its  762 million in 2000 pretax profit and about half its  227 million in 1999 pretax profit  dynegy executives say there isn  t anything wrong with the quality of their company  s earnings  and they point to financial reports for the first nine months of 2001 showing that none of the company  s reported earnings for this year came from unrealized gains \\nother energy traders whose earnings have been boosted in recent years by mark  to  market gains include american electric power  duke energy  el paso  entergy  mirant  pinnacle west capital and williams cos \\nhow much discretion do energy traders have in valuing their contracts  the rule  pretty much  is that there aren  t many rules \\nfor instance  during a conference last week sponsored by the fasb and the american accounting association  attendees were shown a hypothetical example under which the fair value of a power contract could range from  40 million to  153 million  depending on which assumptions of future trends were used \\nand the mark  to  market rules that do exist for energy contracts were crafted in large part on approaches that enron and other traders lobbied for   we developed those rules   enron  s chief accounting officer  richard causey  said in an august interview \\nover the past three years  members of the fasb  s emerging issues task force have extensively debated the subject of how to value energy  related contracts  what they have decided is that companies should be left to their own discretion  though the task force recognizes that could create problems  in a june 2000 report  for instance  the group noted that two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energy contracts  resulting in widely different valuations   those differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value   the report said \\nthe task force  s chairman  tim lucas  says it simply is too difficult to draft a one  size  fits  all solution   there  s no one way to do it  there are various models  and we think it requires professional judgment to assess   further  he says  requiring companies to disclose all the estimates underlying their earnings would produce disclosures so voluminous that they would be of little value \\nthat is in line with the industry  s longtime position  in a june 2000 letter to mr  lucas  for instance  mr  causey said  the valuation process should be determined by individual companies   and the task force  should not address the valuation methodology for energy or energy related contracts  \\nin its financial filings  dynegy explains that when market  price quotes aren  t available for certain long  term contracts   the lack of long  term pricing liquidity requires the use of

chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee \\nall are vowing to get to the bottom of one of the most precipitous business reversals in history  and some members of congress say enron  s downfall  on the heels of california  s energy meltdown early this year  proves that washington must demand more disclosure from energy traders  holding them at least to the standards of wall street firms \\n  enron is the sequela to california  it  s all part of the one  year story line    said representative edward j  markey  democrat of massachusetts  who focuses on energy regulatory issues in the house    we can  t leave energy products in the regulatory shadows  it hurts both investors and consumers   \\nother influential officials are in no rush to turn back the clock on deregulation \\n  we have had a number of false starts  and it would be crazy not to take a look at the lessons we can learn    said nora brownell  one of president bush  s appointees this year to the federal energy regulatory commission    but we should not leap to the conclusion that competitive markets do not work   \\nthe bush administration  along with some democrats   including mr  bingaman and william massey  a democrat on the energy commission   continue to favor plans advanced by enron that would pry open regional electricity markets \\n  we have to look carefully at the causes of consequences of enron  s collapse    mr  bingaman said    but i don  t see anything in this that would keep us from moving ahead with open transmission access and these types of things   \\nthe durability of such views is a sign of how effective enron was during the last decade in keeping washington at bay as the company pushed to restructure the electricity industry and limit government oversight of new energy markets \\nenron and its employees were the largest contributors to president bush  s campaigns over the years  and enron gave more money to politicians in the last election cycle than did any other energy company  since 1993  its employees and its chairman  kenneth l  lay  have donated nearly  2 million to mr  bush  in the 2000 election cycle  more than  1 million was

financial instruments used by enron and other companies to trade energy contracts  mr  lay courted linda robertson  a senior treasury official who was the department  s liaison with congress \\nms  robertson twice accepted paid trips to talk with company executives while she was still employed at the treasury  her financial disclosure shows  the measure that became law  the commodity futures modernization act of 2000  specifically exempted energy trading from the regulatory scrutiny applied to brokers of money  securities and commodities \\nms  robertson  who became the head of enron  s washington office  did not return a phone call seeking comment \\nlast spring  when the bush administration drafted a new national energy policy  mr  lay had a 30  minute meeting with vice president dick cheney to discuss the report  the policy blueprint endorsed breaking up monopoly control of electricity transmission networks  an enron goal that was spelled out in a memorandum mr  lay discussed during his meeting with mr  cheney \\nenron also had an unusual opportunity to influence mr  bush  s choices for the federal energy regulatory commission  which oversees the markets in which enron operates  mr  lay met mr  bush  s personnel adviser  clay johnson  to discuss nominees  when mr  bush picked people to fill two vacant republican slots on the five  member commission  both had the

main challenger for influence in washington  the company has nurtured a loose coalition of southeast lawmakers   the senate minority leader  trent lott of mississippi  most prominent among them   in support of its view that the states should retain leeway in deciding the pace and scope of energy deregulation \\nso far this year  its political action committees have outspent all other energy companies  including enron and big oil companies like exxon mobil  in supporting members of congress  according to the u  s  public interest research group  southern strongly opposes efforts to diminish the power of local regulators to supervise electricity pricing  production and transmission \\n  we have long felt that enron  s vision of open markets does not work with electricity    said dwight evans  executive vice president of the southern company    i think our credibility has been enhanced by recent events   \\nmr  evans said that the federal energy regulatory commission under mr

collapse \\nas the value of energy contracts soared into the hundreds of billions of dollars   at one point up to half all electricity and natural gas transactions passed through enron  s trading

of derivatives crumbled in late 1998 \\nwith its exemption from scrutiny in hand  enron revealed relatively little about its trading portfolio  leaving analysts guessing how it had made its profits  enron  s secrecy was one factor that caused investor confidence to plummet in recent weeks  after the company revealed some unorthodox financial arrangements that benefited top executives \\n  enron was getting very heavily into derivatives  and along with wall street banks  they went to bat to keep us away    said michael greenberger  who was director of trading and markets at the commodities

profitable enterprise suddenly goes bankrupt  there are surely lessons to be learned  when that enterprise is the most admired company in america  lauded by business theorists as the quintessential 21 st  century corporation  one wonders if it is the tip of an iceberg  and how many of us have  without knowing it  booked passage on the titanic \\nit will take time  and many legal proceedings  before the full story of enron  s collapse becomes known  but one thing is already clear  the case shows how adept corporate executives have become at shifting risk away from themselves and onto others  in particular onto their employees  enron  s leaders have walked away from the debacle chastened but very  very rich  many of enron  s employees   no doubt including the loyalists who sent irate letters every time i criticized the company   have lost their life savings \\nbehind this disaster for ordinary workers lies a little  remarked sea change in america  s retirement system  twenty years ago most workers were in   defined benefit   plans   that is  their employers promised them a fixed pension  today most workers have   defined contribution   plans  they invest money for their retirement  and accept the risk that those investments might go bad  retirement contributions are normally subsidized by the employer  and receive special tax treatment  but all this is to no avail if  as happened at enron  the assets workers have bought lose most of their value \\nit  s easy to make the theoretical case for defined  contribution plans  such plans expand an employee  s choices  he can choose how much to save  and how to invest his money  and more choice is ordinarily good \\nbut the sad fate of enron  s employees highlights the difference between theory and practice  as gretchen morgenson of the times pointed out on sunday  workers across the country have been cajoled or coerced into holding a high proportion of their retirement assets in their employers  own stock  the exploitive nature of this financial incest was emphasized by enron  s now  notorious   lockdown    in which   purely by coincidence  say executives   new rules forced employees to remain invested in the company  s stock just as the firm began its death spiral  so much for freedom of choice \\nand even when employees have real choices  one wonders whether they fully appreciate the risks  the shift away from old  fashioned pensions coincided with an enormous bull market  surely many workers who have never seen stock prices fall since they became investors underestimate the risk of capital losses \\none hopes that corporate collapses will not become commonplace  still  it  s highly likely that millions of american workers will have near  enron experiences  learning to their dismay that big chunks of their retirement savings have evaporated  they will be left dependent on the one great defined  benefit program that remains  social security  that is  if it  s still around \\nthe bush administration  s commission on social security reform issued its latest report last week  just as enron entered its death throes  most of the criticism of that commission  s work  my own included  has focused on its  yes  enron  like accounting  items seem to migrate onto or off the balance sheet to suit the commission  s convenience  thus when the social security system takes in more money than it pays out  as it does at present  this has no significance   the federal budget is unified  you see  so it doesn  t mean anything when one particular piece of it is in surplus  but in 2016  when the social security system starts to pay out more than it takes in  there will be a crisis   social security  you see  must stand on its own \\nbut the commission resorts to bogus accounting only to make the case for its ultimate objective  to convert social security from a defined  benefit system  which guarantees retired americans a certain basic income  to a defined  contribution system  in which the unwise or unlucky can find themselves destitute in their old age \\nsome analysts i know think social security will be converted to a defined  contribution system  not because it is a good idea but because the financial industry   which has enormous clout in our money  driven political system   has so much to gain from the conversion  i hope they  re wrong  but if they are right  the fate of enron  s poor employees  victimized by a management team they thought was on their side  may truly be the shape of things to come \\ncopyright  2000 dow jones  company  inc  all rights

an amazing tale of corporate downfall and hubris  and it is providing lessons ranging from the mercilessness of markets to the dangers of forcing people to tie their living and retirement to the same company \\nenron  created in 1985 when houston natural gas combined with a gas  pipeline company  swaggered through the 1990 s  it claimed it would revolutionize life and commerce by substituting the efficient hand of the market for the clumsy hand of government regulation \\nbut enron  s leaders proved to be every bit as bungling as any government bureaucrat  sift through the financial debris  and you see that enron lost about  7 billion on four dumb investments  details below   however profitable enron  s other businesses might have been  paying for those turkeys stretched enron to the breaking point  and it broke  some  60 billion of stockholder value has been wiped out this year  shares that opened the year at  83 closed friday at 26 cents  bankruptcy looms  you wonder if enron field  home of the houston astros baseball team  will be renamed chapter 11 field  or maybe house of cards \\nadding another dimension to the debacle is the intimate relationship between enron and the white house  enron  which for years has tried to ride roughshod over state and federal regulators  has ties throughout the bush administration  for starters  enron and its chairman  kenneth lay  were among george w  bush  s biggest and most important contributors in his texas and presidential campaigns  and according to public records  bush intimates ranging from economic adviser larry lindsay to political adviser karl rove  who owned  100  000 to  250  000 of enron stock  to trade representative robert b  zoellick had been on enron  s payroll before moving to washington  army secretary thomas white jr   a former enron executive  had stock and options worth between  50 million and  100 million \\nin a different environment   remember whitewater    the combination of big losses and white house ties would have long since produced cries for a special prosecutor to see what  if anything  enron  s buddies have done on behalf of the company  the upcoming hearings in the republican  controlled house should be fascinating  and there will doubtless be more hearings in the democratic  controlled senate \\n we  ve had no contact with the white house  since enron  s meltdown started  says company spokesman mark palmer \\n i  m not aware that there have been any requests  from enron  for anything   a white house spokesman says \\neven though enron shareholders have been essentially wiped out  lay isn  t going to the poorhouse  unlike enron employees whose retirement accounts have been vaporized because they consisted largely of enron stock the company wouldn  t let them sell  lay has plenty of wealth left  last year alone  he made  123 million of profit on stock options  according to enron filings  this year he has made an additional  25 million or so  note  on friday  with its stock at around 30 cents  enron changed its policy and allowed employees to sell it \\nironically  what brought down enron from its lofty perch on the fortune 500 list  no  7  is that the markets  whose virtue it preached  lost faith in it after it disclosed funny dealings with a partnership run by its chief financial officer \\nand now  let  s proceed to the syllabus of enron 101 \\n1  bubbles didn  t end\\nwhen dot  coms bombed\\nenron  a major trader of electricity and natural gas  grossed  200 billion a year and had  60 billion of assets  but it turned out to be a bubble  its business depended on borrowing lots of money  people lined up to lend as long as enron seemed healthy  when suspicions arose six weeks ago after the company revealed its partnership problems  money trickled away  then it started leaving in a flood  as enron tottered  it lost trading business  its remaining customers began to gouge it   that  s how trading works in the real world  don  t blame the usual suspects  stock analysts  rather  blame arthur andersen  enron  s outside auditor  which didn  t blow the whistle until it was too late   andersen says it  s far too early for me to be drawing conclusions  \\n2  deregulation can be dangerous\\nit  s clear that the cozy world of utility monopolies needed to be shaken up  given huge losses on nuclear plants and other problems  besides  breakthroughs in turbine technology made it feasible for big users such as manufacturing plants to set up their own generators and drop off the electric grid  letting them go would have raised prices for everyone else  but dereg has caused lots of problems  in 1998  the midwest had huge spikes in the price of electricity and rolling blackouts  some utilities had sold power outside their service areas  and the traders they were relying on to replace that power didn  t deliver  upstarts have dropped in and out of retail markets in several states  sticking established players with big costs  and  of course  there  s california  which got caught with too little energy in the spring  helping enron and others make big profits  and now is stuck with too much expensive energy  this has crippled the state  s finances  driven its biggest utility into bankruptcy and clobbered customers  leaving vital necessities such as electricity and natural gas to the tender mercies of the market is risky  especially when a big player such as enron can vanish overnight \\n3  beware your own hype\\nenron pioneered trading in electricity and natural gas  and it was the primo player in that field  but it came to believe that it was good at everything  it wasn  t  some of the debacles  losses of  2 billion each in the water and telecommunications businesses  and another  2 billion lost in a brazilian utility investment  it blew an additional  1 billion on an electricity  generating plant in india  hence  i think  the need to obscure rising debt levels and less  than  stellar results by dealing with so  called off  balance  sheet partnerships with  star wars  names such as jedi  for joint energy development investments  and chewco  as in chewbacca  the wookiee   the fact that enron executives were involved in these partnerships and made money while the company got clocked didn  t help \\nthe summary\\nthe enron affair reinforces two of the oldest lessons there are  to wit  when

 but the biggest stockbroking outfits are owned by investment banks that also do other types of business  advising companies on mergers  helping them to issue shares or bonds  these advisory businesses create a conflict of interest  in order to cultivate corporations that may hire them  banks are reluctant to allow their stock analysts to issue sell recommendations on their stock  the  chinese walls  that are supposed to guarantee analysts  objectivity by separating them from other parts of their banks are ineffective  and sometimes nonexistent  in some banks  stock analysts who are supposedly working in investors  interests are also expected to work on corporate advisory projects \\nthis kind of conflict may explain why many analysts continued to recommend enron  s stock just a few days before the company  s bankruptcy  in one unfortunate case  lehman brothers rated enron a  strong buy  as it headed toward disaster  it may or may not be coincidental that lehman was in line to earn a large fee for advising on the takeover of enron   a takeover that fell through partly as a result of falls in enron  s stock price \\na similar conflict of interest plagues audit firms  auditors are supposed to serve investors by certifying the accuracy of companies  financial statements  but auditors also earn consulting fees when they advise companies on information technology and other management issues  the desire to win consulting contracts may reduce auditors  appetite for dust  ups with companies whose accounts seem suspicious  enron  s auditor  arthur andersen  earned  27 million in consulting fees from the company last year   slightly more than the  25 million it got paid to audit enron  s books  at the same time it failed to challenge enron  s habit of hiding some of its dicier business in partnerships that went unreported on the balance sheet \\nthe conflicts of interest at stockbrokers and auditors  while similar  demand different remedies  investors themselves are in a position to correct some of the stockbroker problem  they can ignore advice from analysts at the integrated investment banks  and route their business through smaller independent stockbrokers  but the auditor conflicts need to be fixed by regulators at the securities and exchange commission  the commission  s last chairman  arthur levitt  took a tough line with the auditors  his successor

might be needed for enron  s customers  officials said  they just want as much notification as possible to avoid the frightening shortfalls of last winter and spring  when power buyers frantically

california  where utilities no longer buy additional power for their customers and regulators have ended the program that allows new customers to pick an electricity provider other than the

hassell\\ncopyright 2001 houston chronicle\\nas recently as two months ago  enron executives were toasting their decision back in 1999 to plunk down  100 million for the naming rights for houston  s gleaming baseball park \\nbuying the name enron field had done wonders for the ambitious company  s quest of making a name for itself across the nation and around the world  without a doubt  they said  it was worth every penny of the  3  3 million they agreed to pay the houston astros every season for 30 years \\nbut the past 60 days have been a nightmare for the high  tech energy company  with alarming speed  enron has collapsed and is fighting for its survival \\nwith its future in peril  one of the many uncertainties surrounding enron is the identity of its glitzy namesake perched on the eastern edge of downtown \\nwhen baseball fans file into the stadium for the astros  season opener april 2  will the enormous blue letters spelling enron field still loom large over the centerfield scoreboard \\n if you were to ask me the question today  it will be called enron field on april 2   said pam gardner  the astros  president of business operations   but there is so much that could happen  every day could bring a new twist to this deal     we are waiting to see how this plays out  \\nfor now  enron is paid up on its financial obligations to the astros  the baseball club declined to say when the next payment is due  or how large  the team also declined to say what action it might take if enron fails to deliver the cash on time \\nfor its part  enron officials are saying little about the stadium deal  which is relatively small fry when you consider that the company is embroiled in the largest chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in history \\n it  s like every other pre  petition claim   enron spokesman mark palmer said   it will become a matter for the bankruptcy judge  \\nenron field is but one of the many new stadiums experiencing an identity crisis  in baltimore  the super bowl champion ravens play football in a stadium named after a bankrupt internet service provider  but as beleagured as the company is  it has not yet missed a payment  and the place is still called psinet stadium \\nin st  louis  the rams play football in a dome that had been named after twa  but american airlines bought out the carrier  and the twa name has been removed from the stadium \\nthe rams haven  t found another company willing to pony up millions  so the stadium bears the temporary monicker of dome at america  s center \\nas dull as that name is  it  s probably better than what you  ll find in miami  where the dolphins and marlins play in something called pro player stadium  the biggest problem with that is there  s no sportswear company called pro player anymore  it has vanished  although the stadium name remains the same \\nin past naming  rights deals  the heaviest buyers have been high  tech outfits and airlines  both of those industries are in the tank  and it seems unlikely we  ll see any big deals coming from those quarters anytime soon \\n it is a period of uncertainty   said todd gruen  managing editor of a publication called naming rights deals   once we get a handle on where the economy is going  the naming rights industry can find its place as well  \\njust how difficult finding a sponsor can be during this recession is underscored by the experience of the texas rangers \\nthe team  s multimillionaire owner  tom hicks  is hunting for a sponsor to buy the naming rights to what is now called the ballpark at arlington  so far  hicks and the rangers have struck out looking \\n in our weakened economy  everything is kind of on hold   rangers president jim lites told the fort worth star  telegram recently \\nso if enron backs away from the stadium that was to bear its name for the next 28 years  the astros will be hard pressed to quickly find a new corporate partner to fill the void \\n i am guessing it will stay enron field for a while   gruen said \\nin addition to the weak economy and the glut of stadiums chasing after deep  pocketed sponsors  the economics of baseball may be a spooky proposition for companies looking to use the national pastime to buy some goodwill \\nwith no labor contract in place between the owners and the players  the specter of another work stoppage looms over the game  if that weren  t bad enough  baseball  s own commissioner says the game is bleeding  500 million a year  and he is seeking to shut down two franchises before the season starts this spring \\n this uncertainty doesn  t come at a good time for the astros   said dean bonham  chairman of the sports marketing concern called the bonham group   major league baseball is on the precipice of a disaster  it is almost assured there will

2001 houston chronicle\\nnew york   enron corp  took steps monday to ensure funding for its day  to  day operations  but the company faces a difficult struggle in the months ahead as it tries rebuild itself \\nin new york monday  u  s  bankruptcy court judge arthur gonzalez approved a plan for a group of lenders led by j  p  morgan chase  co  and citigroup to lend enron  250 million now  another  250 million by jan  7 and  if all goes well  another  1 billion after that \\nthe goal is to ensure that enron  s core energy trading business survives as a viable entity  by giving other companies confidence they can still do business with enron and expect to be paid \\nenron officials estimate its trading business alone is worth  6 billion to  7 billion  said martin bienenstock  an attorney with weil  gotshal  manges  representing enron in the bankruptcy case \\nenron currently has about  500 million in cash on hand  down from about  2  5 billion it typically had on hand before its crisis began  bienenstock said \\nenron may never need to dip into that extra  1  5 billion in cash  bienenstock said  but just having the funds available eases its financial stress \\n if we don  t get this credit  we may need it tomorrow   bienenstock told the court monday   if we do get it  we may never need it  \\nlenders who make such financing in a bankruptcy proceeding typically get high priority for repayment and their loans come with high interest rates and high underwriting fees \\nenron chief executive officer ken lay  who didn  t attend monday  s hearing  said in a statement the  250 million will be used to help enron fulfill obligations needed to run its business  such as employee payroll and vendor payments for goods and services provided on or after sunday  s bankruptcy filing \\nenron also is negotiating with three financial institutions in the hopes of revitalizing its wholesale trading business under a new ownership structure  bienenstock expects those talks to be completed within weeks \\ngonzalez also signed off on a provision to let enron pay up to  4  500 in severance pay to workers being laid off  workers could get additional severance payments later as the bankruptcy progresses \\na small number of employees may be eligible for up to  15  000 to cover travel and other expenses incurred but not reimbursed before enron sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the u  s  bankruptcy code \\nenron also will be allowed to keep making payments on its  219 million office tower that  s still under construction in downtown houston  enron has already paid  180 million toward the construction costs and any buyer of the property would need to complete the work to realize any value from the project \\njeff mcmahon  enron  s chief financial officer  was the company  s top executive at the hearing   i  m extremely disappointed to have to be here at all   he said during a break in the session \\nas the bankruptcy progresses  enron and its creditors will examine the various parts of the company and decide whether they would be more valuable being sold off or kept as ongoing operations \\nenron  s major creditors will meet on dec  12 to form a creditors committee  which will negotiate with the company on behalf of those still owed money  enron officials will be back in bankruptcy court for another hearing on dec  14 \\nenron  s chapter 11 filing is the largest bankruptcy case in u  s  corporate history  not surprisingly  gonzalez  s courtroom was packed monday with more than 125 attorneys and reporters \\nenron and 13 of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors after a planned merger with dynegy fell apart and cuts in enron  s credit rating triggered serious problems for the company \\nenron listed assets of  49  8 billion and liabilities of  31  2 billion  though it has other debt obligations not listed on the filings \\nas enron decided where to file  it probably considered that houston and new york have among the nation  s most sophisticated bankruptcy judges and lawyers in the country  said nancy rapoport  dean of the university of houston law center and a bankruptcy specialist \\nchoosing new york  she said  let enron avoid local issues hovering around the courthouse  and that includes current or laid  off enron workers \\nmonday  s hearing was just the first step in a process that could take a year or more  despite enron  s statements that it plans to emerge from bankruptcy protection with a rebuilt business of some type  the odds do not favor it \\n it  s challenging  but not impossible   said rapoport   a lot has to go right  \\neighty percent to 90 percent of companies will fail in their chapter 11 efforts  said jack williams  a law professor at the georgia state university college of law and scholar  in  residence at the american bankruptcy institute  a nonprofit think tank \\nthose that fail   even those that go in intending to reorganize   typically end up liquidating all their assets either in the chapter 11 proceeding or converting to a chapter 7 liquidation case  he said \\nthe biggest potential obstacles to success  a too  small asset base  not enough cash and a poor business plan  he said \\nas a case unfolds  it  s not uncommon for the true value of a company  s assets to turn out below the company  s numbers  williams said \\nsome companies actually file for chapter 11  even though they intend to liquidate assets  experts said  as doing so gives them more control over a selloff  under a chapter 7 filing  a court  appointed trustee handles the liquidation \\nbefore it filed  enron had put much of its portfolio of international assets up for sale  any deals now need approval from the court  with proceeds going to creditors \\nthe creditors committee has a voice in virtually everything that is considered by the judge  said joel kay  an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy cases at hughes  watters  askanase l  l  p  in houston \\nthat includes an opinion on whatever reorganization plan enron files with the court \\nonce a bankruptcy petition is made  the company cannot pay any debts incurred before the filing without permission from the judge  kay said \\nenron is expected to immediately start sorting through its leases and contracts  deciding what it needs to run the business and what is not needed \\nfor those the judge agrees to let enron keep  it will be allowed to make payments for future goods and services  companies with contracts enron is allowed to reject will be considered creditors \\nenron does not need court approval to spend money on what is considered the normal course of business  but if it wants to sell assets  borrow money or do something out of the ordinary  it must ask \\nfor example  if enron reaches a plan to revamp its trading operation  the court will need to approve \\nseveral stock analysts expressed doubt that enron will come out of chapter 11 or be able to make its trading operation work again  even if a new trading joint venture is created \\nandre meade of commerzbank securities in new york said buyers and sellers of energy  are not going to come back to this new entity in droves  \\n i  m having a hard time thinking of a scenario where you can actually get a workable entity out of this chapter 11   he said   it  s going to be hard for them to reorganize around anything  they may not emerge from chapter 11  \\nhe expects shareholders   generally at the bottom of the creditor pool in a bankruptcy filing   will most likely get nothing out of the bankruptcy filing \\nthe efforts of shareholders and employees who sued enron will be delayed or halted \\nsuch lawsuits are stayed and attorneys will have to seek permission of the bankruptcy court to move ahead \\ndec  4  2001\\nhouston chronicle\\nq  a on the enron bankruptcy\\nwhy did enron file for bankruptcy \\nenron  s increasing problems   particularly the reduction in its bond rating to junk bond status   triggered billions in claims that it could not afford to pay  filing for bankruptcy protection allows it to avoid paying creditors while it works out a plan to reorganize the company \\nhow will the company fund its day  to  day business going forward \\nthe two top priorities now are finding a source of financing for its day  to  day operations and getting permission from the bankruptcy court to pay essential expenses   such as their payroll and the cost of benefits like health insurance \\nat this point why would anyone lend them another penny \\nafter filing for bankruptcy companies normally seek what is known as debtor  in  possession financing  lenders that provide such financing go to the front of the line when it comes time to get paid back  this agreement  which normally pays a top interest rate  has to be approved by other creditors  the creditors normally go along because continued operations will mean a bigger payout than a complete liquidation \\nwho will get paid back \\nbankruptcy law sets the priorities in a bankruptcy  first in line are those with debts secured by the company  s property  at the bottom are common shareholders  in the middle are unsecured creditors  however  this is all subject to negotiation by the committees representing the parties in the suit \\nif common shareholders are the last to get paid  why did the stock rise \\nthere  s no good explanation  sometimes at the start of a big case  certain parties will buy shares to win a place on the committee representing shareholders  other buyers are traders who see a short  term profit to be made in the price movement of the stock  which trades in pennies \\nwill enron be able to come back \\nthat depends on whether management can pare this once huge company down to a profitable core  officials within enron have warned the surviving company may be far different than what you see today  often many operations are sold to raise cash to preserve a few key parts \\ndec  4  2001  11  23 pm\\nhouston chronicle\\nenron  s recent troubles\\naug  14\\njeff skilling  who served as ceo for six months  steps down for personal reasons  ken lay

    "**Results interpretation**\n",
    "- The most common terms found in ham emails are ``emailaddress``, the marker I used to replace the names and email addresses of senders and recipients, and ``enron``. \n",
    "    - Maybe this is due to spam emails in the dataset not having the sender and recipient information. In reality, the senders' email addresses can also be obtained from spam emails.\n",
    "    - But the email address can still be used as a feature. For example, if person A has had previous email correspondence with person B in the past, then future emails coming from person B's email address are likely not spam. Person A most likely has regular email correspondence with specific people they work with, so emails coming from that list of specific people can be tagged as not spam. \n",
    "    - Aside from having a list of email contacts, it's also possible to check the email domain, or what comes after ``@``, to see if the email came from a company account. For example, for GCash employees, emails coming from addresses that end with ``@gcash.com`` can be tagged as not spam. \n",
    "- Meanwhile, the most common terms found in spam emails are ``url``, the marker I used to replace web addresses beginning with either ``http`` or ``https``, and ``software``. Indeed one telling sign that an email is spam is if it invites users to click suspicious links and visit unsafe websites. Another sign is if the email asks users to download ``software`` that might contain malware. \n",
    "- Thus, spam classification models can be created based not only on the content of the emails (e.g. if email has specific words), but also on the subjects of the emails and email addresses of the senders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "- By running error analysis and looking at some cases that the model misclassified, I found out that some of the emails were written in non-English languages. Because most of the emails in the dataset were in English, the resulting tf-idf matrix consisted mostly of English words. Thus, the model found it difficult to classify non-English emails that contained many words that the model hasn't seen before.  \n",
    "- Some spam emails contained nonsense or random permutations of letters. To detect that nonsense, I tried to add a feature based on the number of unusual words in the email, where an unusual word is something that's not in nltk's corpus of 236,736 English words. However, because of the multiple language problem, non-English emails would have high values for that feature. It would be possible to use corpora of multiple languages, but implementation would be really slow, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "- Other spam emails contained valid English words that when put together make no sense. For example, one spam email had the words ``strong pasteboard anonymous square sprite capital`` in that specific sequence. When the words are taken individually, they don't look like words common in spam, but when they appear in one sentence, they look like garbage. The takeaway from this example is that the context of words are used in sentences matters. Maybe for future implementations, the occurrence of multiple words together in a text could be used as features.    "
